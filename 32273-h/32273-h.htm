<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<div class='cap'>WE live in a land of heroes. If there is
any one thing for which a true son of
America is always ready, it is for a
deed of heroism. We have among us heroes
of the workshop, of the railroad, of field,
forest, and city, heroes of land and heroes of
water, heroes in war and heroes in peace.
When the time comes for any deed of valor to
be done, the American ready and able to do it
will not be found wanting. It is not glory the
gallant son of our land is seeking. It is to do
his duty in whatever situation he is placed,
whether high or low, on quarter-deck or forecastle.
He does not stop to think of fame. To
act bravely for his fellows or his country is the
thing for him to do, and he does it in face of
every peril.</div>

<p>The history of the United States is full of
the names of heroes. They stand out like the
stars on our flag. It is not our purpose to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>boast. The world has had its heroes in all
times and countries. But our land holds a
high rank among heroic nations, and deeds of
gallant daring have been done by Americans
which no men upon the earth have surpassed.</p>

<p>This book is the record of our heroes of the
sea, of the men who have fought bravely upon
the ocean for the honor of the Stars and
Stripes, the noble tars who have carried their
country's fame over all waters and through all
wars. Look at Paul Jones, the most gallant
sailor who ever trod deck! He was not born on
our soil, but he was a true-blue American for
all that. Look at Perry, rowing from ship to
ship amid the rain of British shot and shell!
Look at Farragut in the Civil War, facing
death in the rigging that he might see the
enemy! Look at Dewey in the war with Spain,
on the bridge amid the hurtling Spanish shells!
These are but types of our gallant sailors.
They have had their equals in every war. We
have hundreds to-day as brave. All they wait
for is opportunity. When the time comes they
will be ready.</p>

<p>If all our history is an inspiration, our naval
history is specially so. It is full of thrilling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>tales, stories of desperate deeds and noble valor
which no work of fiction can surpass. We are
sure that all who take up this book will find it
vital with interest and brimming with inspiration.
Its tales deal with men who fought for
their land with only a plank between them and
death, and none among us can read the story
of their deeds without a thrill in the nerves and
a stir in the heart, and without a wish that
sometime they may be able to do as much for
the land that gave them birth. This is a book
for the American boy to read, and the American
girl as well; a book to fill them with the
spirit of emulation and make them resolve that
when the time comes they will act their part
bravely in the perilous work of the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE FIRST SEA FIGHT OF THE REVOLUTION</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Burning of the "Gaspee" in Narragansett Bay</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>DOES it not seem an odd fact that little
Rhode Island, the smallest of all our
states, should have two capital cities,
while all the others, some of which would make
more than a thousand Rhode Islands, have
only one apiece? It is like the old story of the
dwarf beating the giants.</div>

<p>The tale we have to tell has to do with these
two cities, Providence and Newport, whose
story goes back far into the days when Rhode
Island and all the others were British colonies.
They were capitals then and they are
capitals still. That is, they were places where
the legislature met and the laws were made.</p>

<p>I need not tell you anything about the British
Stamp Act, the Boston Tea-party, the fight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
at Lexington, and the other things that led to
the American Revolution and brought freedom
to the colonies. All this you have learned
at school. But I am sure you will be interested
in what we may call the "salt-water Lexington,"
the first fight between the British and
the bold sons of the colonies.</p>

<p>There was at that time a heavy tax on all
goods brought into the country, and even on
goods taken from one American town to another.
It was what we now call a revenue
duty, or tariff. This tax the Americans did
not like to pay. They were so angry at the
way they had been treated by England that
they did not want that country to have a penny
of their money. Nor did they intend to pay
any tax.</p>

<p>Do you ask how they could help paying the
tax? They had one way of doing so. Vessels
laden with goods were brought to the coast at
night, or to places where there was no officer
of the revenue. Then in all haste they unloaded
their cargoes and were away again like
flitting birds. The British did not see half the
goods that came ashore, and lost much in the
way of taxes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>We call this kind of secret trade "smuggling."
Providence and Newport were great
smuggling places. Over the green waters of
Narragansett Bay small craft sped to and fro,
coming to shore by night or in secret places
and landing their goods. It was against the
law, but the bold mariners cared little for laws
made in England. They said that they were
quite able to govern themselves, and that no
people across the seas should make laws for
them.</p>

<p>The British did their best to stop this kind
of trade. They sent armed vessels to the Bay,
whose business it was to chase and search
every craft that might have smuggled goods
in its hold, and to punish in some way every
smuggler they found.</p>

<p>Some of these vessels made themselves very
busy, and sailors and shoremen alike were
bitter against them. They would bring in
prizes to Newport, and their sailors would
swagger about the streets, bragging of what
they had done, and making sport of the
Yankees. They would kidnap sailors and
carry them off to serve in the King's ships.
One vessel came ashore at Newport, whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
crew had been months at sea, trading on the
African coast. Before a man of them could
set foot on land, or see any of the loved ones
at home, from whom they had been parted so
long, a press-gang from a British ship-of-war
seized and carried off the whole crew, leaving
the captain alone on his deck.</p>

<p>We may be sure that all this made the people
very indignant. While the rest of the
country was quiet, the Newporters were at the
point of war. More than once they were ready
to take arms against the British.</p>

<p>In July, 1769, a British armed sloop, the
<i>Liberty</i>, brought in two prizes as smugglers.
They had no smuggled goods on board, but the
officers of the <i>Liberty</i> did not care for that.
And their captains and crews were treated as
if they were prisoners of war.</p>

<p>That night something new took place. The
lookout on the <i>Liberty</i> saw two boats, crowded
with men, gliding swiftly toward the sloop.</p>

<p>"Boat ahoy!" he shouted.</p>

<p>Not a word came in reply.</p>

<p>"Boat ahoy! Answer, or I'll fire!"</p>

<p>No answer still. The lookout fired. The
watch came rushing up on deck. But at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
same time the men in the boats climbed over
the bulwarks and the sailors of the <i>Liberty</i>
found themselves looking into the muzzles of
guns. They were taken by surprise and had
to yield. The Americans had captured their
first prize.</p>

<p>Proud of their victory, the Newporters cut
the cables of the sloop and let her drift ashore.
Her captives were set free, her mast was cut
down, and her boats were dragged through the
streets to the common, where they were set on
fire. A jolly bonfire they made, too, and as the
flames went up the people cheered lustily.</p>

<p>That was not all. With the high tide the
sloop floated off. But it went ashore again
on Goat Island, and the next night some of
the people set it on fire and it was burned to
the water's edge. That was the first American
reply to British tyranny. The story of it spread
far and wide. The King's officers did all they
could to find and punish the men who had captured
the sloop, but not a man of them could
be discovered. Everybody in the town knew,
but no one would tell.</p>

<p>This was only the beginning. The great
event was that of the <i>Gaspee</i>. This was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
British schooner carrying six cannon, which
cruised about the Bay between Providence and
Newport, and made itself so active and so
offensive that the people hated it more than all
those that had gone before. Captain Duddingstone
treated every vessel as if it had been
a pirate, and the people were eager to give it
the same dose they had given the <i>Liberty</i>.</p>

<p>Their time came in June, 1772. The <i>Hannah</i>,
a vessel trading between New York and
Providence, came in sight of the <i>Gaspee</i> and
was ordered to stop. But Captain Linzee had
a fine breeze and did not care to lose it. He kept
on at full speed, and the <i>Gaspee</i> set out in chase.</p>

<p>It was a very pretty race that was seen that
day over the ruffled waters of the Bay. For
twenty-five miles it kept up and the <i>Hannah</i>
was still ahead. Then the two vessels came
near to Providence bar.</p>

<p>The Yankee captain now played the British
sailors a cute trick. He slipped on over the bar
as if there had been a mile of water under his
keel. The <i>Gaspee</i>, not knowing that the <i>Hannah</i>
had almost touched bottom, followed, and
in a minute more came bump upon the ground.
The proud war-vessel stuck fast in the mud,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
while the light-footed Yankee slid swiftly on
to Providence, where the story of the chase
and escape was told to eager ears.</p>

<p>Here was a splendid chance. The <i>Gaspee</i>
was aground. Now was the time to repay Captain
Duddingstone for his pride and insolence.
That night, while the people after their day's
work were standing and talking about the
news, a man passed down the streets, beating
a drum and calling out:</p>

<p>"The <i>Gaspee is aground</i>. Who will join in
to put an end to her?"</p>

<p>There was no lack of volunteers. Eight
large boats had been collected from the ships
in the harbor, and there were soon enough to
crowd them all. Sixty-four men were selected,
and Abraham Whipple, who was afterward
one of the first captains in the American navy,
took command. Some of the men had guns,
but their principal weapons were paving stones
and clubs.</p>

<p>It was about two o'clock in the morning
when this small fleet came within hail of the
<i>Gaspee</i>. She was fast enough yet, though she
was beginning to lift with the rising tide. An
hour or two more might have set her afloat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>A sentinel who was pacing the deck hailed
the boats when they came near.</p>

<p>"Who comes there?" he cried.</p>

<p>A shower of paving stones that rattled on
the deck of the <i>Gaspee</i> was the only answer.
Up came the captain and crew, like bees from
a hive that has been disturbed.</p>

<p>"I want to come on board," said Captain
Whipple.</p>

<p>"Stand off. You can't come aboard," answered
Captain Duddingstone.</p>

<p>He fired a pistol. A shot from one of the
guns on the boats replied. The British captain
fell with a bullet in his side.</p>

<p>"I am sheriff of the County of Kent," cried
one of the leaders in the boats. "I am come
for the captain of this vessel. Have him I
will, dead or alive. Men, to your oars!"</p>

<p>On came the boats, up the sides of the vessel
clambered the men, over the rails they
passed. The sailors showed fight, but they
were soon knocked down and secured. The
proud <i>Gaspee</i> was in the hands of the despised
Yankees.</p>

<p>As the captors were tying the crew, a surgeon
who was in the boats was called on deck.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you want, Mr. Brown?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Don't call names, man," cried Brown. "Go
into the cabin. There is a wounded man there
who may bleed to death."</p>

<p>The surgeon was needed, for Captain Duddingstone
was bleeding freely. The surgeon,
finding no cloth for bandages, tore his own
shirt into strips for this purpose, and soon had
the bleeding stopped. The captain was gently
lowered into one of the boats and rowed up to
Providence.</p>

<p>The wounded man away, the captors began
their work. Rushing through the vessel, they
made havoc of furniture and trappings. There
were some bottles of liquor in the captain's
cabin, and some of the men made a rush for
these; but the surgeon smashed them with the
heels of his boots. That was not the time or
place for drunken men.</p>

<p>This done, the <i>Gaspee</i> was set on fire, and
was soon wrapped in flames. The men rowed
their boats some distance out, and there rested
on their oars, watching the flames as they shot
up masts and rigging. Not until the loaded
guns went off, one after another, and in the
end the magazine was reached and the ship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
blew up, did they turn their prows towards
home. Never again would the <i>Gaspee</i> trouble
American ships.</p>

<p>When word of what had been done reached
England, there was fury from the King
down. Great rewards were offered for any
one who would betray any of the party, but
not a name was told. For six long months a
court of inquiry sat, but it could not get evidence
enough to convict a single man. The
Americans were staunch and firm and stood
for each other like brothers tried and true.</p>

<p>Not until the colonies threw off the royal
yoke and were battling for freedom was the
secret told. Then the men of the long-boats
did not hesitate to boast of what they had done.
It was the first stroke of America in the cause
of liberty, and the work of the men of Providence
gave new heart to the patriots from
Maine to Georgia.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>A BRITISH SCHOONER CAPTURED BY FARMERS IN 1775</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Captain Jerry O'Brien Leads the Patriots of 1775</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>HOW would any of you like to go back to
the days when people had only tallow
candles to light their houses, and the
moon to light their streets, when they traveled
on horseback or by stage, and got their news
only when it happened to come? In these days
of the electric light, the railroad train, and the
telegraph that old way of living would not
seem living at all.</div>

<p>Yet that was the way people lived in 1775
when the Revolution began. It took weeks for
news to travel then, where it takes seconds
now. Thus the fight at Lexington, which
began the Revolution, took place on April 19th,
but it was May 9th, more than half a month
later, before the news of it reached the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
town of Machias, on the coast of Maine. We
should hardly call that fast time. It must have
taken several naps on the way.</p>

<p>But when the news came, it found the people
ready for it. A coasting schooner put into the
port and brought the story of how the patriots
had fought and bled at Lexington and Concord,
and of how the British were shut up in
Boston town, and the country was at war. The
news was received with ringing cheers.</p>

<p>If any of my readers had been at Machias
that day I know they would have felt like
striking a blow for liberty. At any rate, that
is how the people of Machias felt, and it did
not take them long to show it.</p>

<p>They had some reason not to like the King
and his men. All the tall, straight trees in
their woods were kept to make masts for the
King's ships, and no woodman dared set axe to
one of these pine trees except at risk of going
to prison. Just then there were two sloops in
their harbor loading with ship-timber, and an
armored schooner, the <i>Margaretta</i>, was there
as a good looker-on.</p>

<p>When the men on the wharf heard the story
of Lexington, their eyes fell on the <i>Margaretta</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Here was a chance to let King George
know what they thought about his robbing
their woods.</p>

<p>"Keep this a secret," they said to the sailors.
"Not a word of it to Captain Moore or his
men. Wait till to-morrow and you will see
some sport."</p>

<p>That night sixty of the countrymen and
townsmen met at a farmhouse nearby and laid
their plans. It was Saturday. On Sunday
Captain Moore and his officers would go to
church. Then they could gather at the wharf
and might take the schooner by surprise.</p>

<p>But it is often easier to make a plot than to
keep it a secret, and that lesson they were to
learn. The captain and his officers went to the
little village church at sound of the morning
bell; the <i>Margaretta</i> lay lazily floating near
the shore; and the plotters began to gather,
two or three at a time strolling down towards
the shore, each of them carrying some weapon.</p>

<p>But in some way Captain Moore discovered
their purpose. What bird in the air whispered
to him the secret we do not know, but he suddenly
sprang to his feet, called to his officers
to follow him, and leaped like a cat through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
church window, without waiting to go round
by the door. We may be sure the old-fashioned
preacher and the pious people in the pews
looked on with wide-open eyes.</p>

<p>Down the street like a deer sped the captain.
After him came his officers. In their rear
rushed the patriots, some carrying old muskets,
some with scythes and reaping-hooks.</p>

<p>It was a hot flight and a hot chase. Luckily
for Captain Moore the guard on the schooner
was wide-awake. He saw the countrymen
chasing his captain, and at once loaded and
fired a gun, whose ball went whistling over the
head of the men of Maine. This was more
than they looked for; they held back in doubt;
some of them sought hiding places; before
they could gain fresh courage, a boat put off
from the schooner and took the captain and his
officers on board.</p>

<p>Captain Moore did not know what was
wrong, but he thought he would frighten the
people, at any rate. So his cannon thundered
and balls came hurtling over the town. Then
he drew up his anchor and sailed several miles
down the bay, letting the anchor fall again
near a high bank. Some of the townsmen followed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
and a man named Foster called from
the bank, bidding him surrender. But the
captain laughed at him, raised his anchor once
more, and ran farther out into the bay.</p>

<p>It looked as if the whole affair was at an end
and the <i>Margaretta</i> safe. But the men of
Machias were not yet at the end of their rope.
There lay the lumber sloops, and where a
schooner could go a sloop could follow.</p>

<p>Early Monday morning four young men
climbed to the deck of one of the sloops and
cheered in a way that soon brought a crowd to
the wharf. One of these was a bold, gallant
fellow named Jeremiah O'Brien.</p>

<p>"What is in the wind?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We are going for the King's ship," said
Wheaton, one of the men. "We can outsail
her, and all we want is guns enough and men
enough to take her."</p>

<p>"My boys, we can do it," cried O'Brien in
lusty tones, after hearing the plan.</p>

<p>Everybody ran off for arms, but all they
could find in the town were twenty guns, with
enough powder and balls to make three shots
for each. Their other weapons were thirteen
pitchforks and twelve axes. Jerry O'Brien<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
was chosen captain, thirty-five of the most
athletic men were selected, and the sloop put
off before a fresh breeze for the first naval
battle of the Revolution.</p>

<p>It is likely that there were a few sailors
among them, and no doubt their captain knew
how to handle a sloop. But the most of them
were landsmen, chiefly haymakers, for Machias
lay amid grassy meadows and the making
of hay was its chief business. And there were
some woodsmen, who knew well how to swing
an axe. They were all bold men and true,
who cared more for their country than for the
King.</p>

<p>When Captain Moore saw the sloop coming
with its deck crowded with men he must have
wondered what all this meant. What ailed
these countrymen? Anyhow, he would not
fight without knowing what he was fighting
for, so he raised his anchor, set his sails, and
made for the open sea. But he had hardly
started when, in going about in the strong
wind, the main boom swung across so sharply
that it struck the backstays and broke short off.</p>

<p>I fancy if any of us had been close by then
we would have heard ringing cheers from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Yankee crew. They felt sure now of their
prize, though we cannot see why, for the <i>Margaretta</i>
had twenty-four cannon, four throwing
six-pound balls and the rest one-pound
balls. Muskets and pitchforks did not seem of
much use against these. It had also more men
than the sloop.</p>

<p>We cannot see why Captain Moore showed
his heels instead of his fists, for he soon proved
that he was no coward. But he still seemed
to want to get away, so he drew up beside a
schooner that lay at anchor, robbed it of its
boom, lashed it to his own mast and once more
took to flight. But the sloop was now not far
behind, and soon showed that it was the better
sailer of the two. In the end it came so close
that Captain Moore was forced to fight or yield.</p>

<p>One of the swivel guns was fired, and then
came a whole broadside, sending its balls hurtling
over the crowded deck of the sloop. One
man fell dead, but no other harm was done.</p>

<p>Only a single shot was fired back, but this
came from a heavy gun and was aimed by an
old hunter. It struck the man at the helm of
the schooner. He fell dead, letting the rudder
swing loose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Margaretta</i>, with no hand at her helm,
broached to, and in a minute more the sloop
came crashing against her. At once there
began a fierce battle between the British tars
and the haymakers of Maine, who sprang
wildly and with ringing cheers for the schooner's
deck. Weapons of all sorts now came into
play. Cutlasses, hand-grenades, pistols and
boarding pikes were used by the schooner's
men; muskets, pitchforks, and axes were skilfully
handled by the crew of the sloop. Men
fast fell dead and wounded; the decks grew red
with blood; both sides fought fiercely, the men
of Machias striving like tigers to gain a footing
on the schooner's deck, the British tars
meeting and driving them back.</p>

<p>Captain Moore showed that it was not fear
that made him run away. He now fought
bravely at the head of his men, cheering them
on and hurling hand-grenades at the foe.</p>

<p>But in a few minutes the end came. A
bullet struck the gallant captain and he fell
dead on his deck. When they saw him fall the
crew lost heart and drew back. The Yankees
swarmed over the bulwarks. In a minute more
the <i>Margaretta</i> was theirs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>The battle, though short, had been desperate,
for twenty men lay killed and wounded, more
than a fourth of the whole number engaged.</p>

<p>As Bunker Hill showed British soldiers that
the Yankees could fight on land, so the capture
of the <i>Margaretta</i>, the first naval victory of
the Americans, showed that they could fight at
sea. The <i>Margaretta</i> was very much the
stronger, in men, in guns, and in her trained
officers and skilled crew. Yet she had been
taken by a party of landsmen, with muskets
against cannon and pitchforks against pistols.
It was a victory of which the colonists could
well be proud.</p>

<p>But Captain O'Brien was not yet satisfied.
He had now a good sloop under his feet, a
good crew at his back, and the arms and ammunition
of his prize. He determined to go
a-privateering on his own account.</p>

<p>Taking the <i>Margaretta</i> to the town, he
handed over his prisoners and put the cannon
and swivels of the schooner on his swifter
sloop, together with the muskets, pistols, powder,
and shot which he found on board. Then
away he went, with a bold and daring crew, in
search for prizes and glory.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>He soon found both. When the news of
what he had done reached Halifax, the British
there sent out two schooners, with orders to
capture the insolent Yankee and bring him to
port and to prison. But Captain O'Brien
showed that he knew how to handle a sloop as
well as a pitchfork. He met the schooners
sent to capture him, and by skilful sailing managed
to separate them. Then he made a bold
dash on each of them and in a little time captured
them both.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>BENEDICT ARNOLD, THE SOLDIER-SAILOR</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Novel Fight on Lake Champlain</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>WAS it not a dreadful pity that Benedict
Arnold should disgrace himself forever
by becoming a traitor to his
country? To think of his making himself the
most despised of all Americans, when, if he
had been true to his flag, he might have been
ranked among our greatest heroes. For Arnold
was one of the best and bravest fighters
in Washington's army. And he could fight as
hard and well on water as on land, as you will
learn when you read of what he did on Lake
Champlain.</div>

<p>I am sure all my readers must know where
this lake is, and how it stretches down in a
long line from Canada far into New York
State. Below Lake Champlain extends Lake
George, and not very far from that is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Hudson River, which flows down to the City
of New York.</p>

<p>If the British could only have held that line
of water they would have cut the colonies in
two, and in that way they might soon have
brought the war to an end. This was what
they tried to do in the fall of 1776, but they
did not count on Arnold and his men.</p>

<p>Let us tell what brought this about. General
Arnold and General Montgomery had
marched through the wilderness to Quebec in
the winter before. But there they met with
bitter weather and deadly disease and death
from cold and cannon. The brave Montgomery
was killed, the daring Arnold fought in
vain, and in the end the invading army was
forced to march back&mdash;all that was left of it.</p>

<p>As the Americans went back, Sir Guy Carleton,
the British commander, followed, and
made his camp at St. John's, at the north end
of Lake Champlain. The nearest American
post was at Crown Point, far down towards
the foot of the lake. Not far south of this,
near the head of Lake George, was the famous
old French fort Ticonderoga, which Arnold
and Ethan Allen had captured from the British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the year before. I tell you all this that you
may know how the land lay. A glance at a
good map will help.</p>

<p>I think it very likely that some of you may
have visited those beautiful lakes, and seen the
towns and villages on their shores, the handsome
dwelling on their islands, and the broad
roads along their banks; everything gay and
smiling.</p>

<p>If you had been there in 1776 you would
have seen a very different sight. Look right
or left, east or west, nothing but a wilderness
of trees would have met your eyes. As for
roads, I fancy an Indian trail would have been
the best to be found. And no man that wished
to keep his scalp on his head would have
thought of living on island or shore.</p>

<p>The only good road southward was the liquid
one made by nature, and this road Carleton
decided to take. He would build a strong fleet
and carry his army down the lake, while the
Indians that came with him could paddle
downward in their canoes.</p>

<p>At this time there was not a vessel on the
lakes, but Carleton worked hard, and soon had
such a fleet as these waters had never seen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Three of his ships were built in England in
such a way that they could be taken to pieces,
carried through the wilderness to St. John's,
and there put together again. The smaller
vessels were built on the spot, soldiers, sailors,
and farmers all working on them.</p>

<p>It was well on in October before his task
was finished. Then he had a fleet of twenty-five
vessels in all, twenty of them being gunboats,
but some of them quite large. Their
crews numbered a thousand men, and they carried
eighty-nine cannon.</p>

<p>You may well suppose that the Americans
knew what was going on, and that they did
not fold their hands and wait. That is not,
and never was, the American way. If the
British could build, so could the Yankees, and
Benedict Arnold was ordered to build a fleet,
and to have it ready for fighting the British
when it would be needed.</p>

<p>Arnold had been at sea in his time and knew
something of what he was about. His men
were farmers who had taken up arms for their
country, but he sent for a few shipbuilders
from the coast and went to work with all his
might.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>When October came he had fifteen vessels
afloat. There were two schooners and one
sloop, the others being called galleys and gondolas&mdash;no
better than large rowboats, with
three to six guns each.</p>

<p>Arnold had about as many guns as Carleton,
but they were smaller, and he had not
nearly so many men to handle them. And his
men were farmers instead of sailors, and knew
no more about a cannon than about a king's
crown. But the British ships were manned
by picked seamen from the warships in the
St. Lawrence River, and had trained naval
officers.</p>

<p>I fear if any of us had been in Arnold's
place we would have wanted to go home. It
looked like folly for him and his men to fight
the British fleet with its skilled officers and
sailors and its heavy guns. It was like meeting
a raft of logs with one of chips.</p>

<p>But Arnold was not a man who stopped to
count the cost when fighting was to be had.
As soon as he was ready he set sail boldly up
the lake, and on the morning of October 11,
1776, he drew up his little fleet across a narrow
channel between Valcour Island and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
west shore of the lake. He knew the British
would soon be down.</p>

<p>It was a fine, clear, cool morning, with a
strong wind from the north, just the kind of
day Carleton had been waiting for. So, soon
after sunrise, his fleet came sweeping on past
Valcour Island. But all the sailors saw was a
thicket of green trees, and they had got well
south of the island before they looked back and
saw the American fleet.</p>

<p>Here was an ugly situation. It would never
do to leave the Americans in their rear. Down
went the helms, round swept the sails, out came
the oars, and soon the British fleet was making
a struggle against the wind which had seemed
so fair a few minutes before. So strong was
the breeze that ten o'clock had passed before
they reached the channel in which the Americans
lay. Arnold came eagerly to meet them,
with the <i>Royal Savage</i>, his largest vessel, and
three of his gondolas. One of these, the <i>Congress</i>,
he had made his flagship. Soon the
waters of that quiet bay rang with the roar of
cannon and the shouts of fighting men, and
Arnold, having drawn the fire of the whole
British fleet, was obliged to hurry back.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>In doing so he met with a serious loss. The
<i>Royal Savage</i>, pierced by a dozen balls, ran
ashore on the island. As she could not be got
off, the crew set her on fire and escaped to the
woods. They might better have leaped into
the lake, for the woods were full of Indians
whom Carleton had sent ashore; and to be a
prisoner to Indians in those days was a terrible
fate.</p>

<p>When he got back to his fleet, Arnold
formed his line to meet the British, who came
steadily on until within musket shot. Then a
furious battle began, broadside meeting broadside,
grape-shot and round-shot hurtling
through the air, the thick smoke of the conflict
drifting into the woodland, while from the
forest came back flame and bullets as the Indians
fought for their British friends.</p>

<p>Arnold, on the deck of the <i>Congress</i>, led in
the thickest of the fight, handling his fleet as
if he had been an admiral born, cheering the
men at the guns, aiming and firing a gun at
intervals himself, and not yielding a foot to
the foe. Now and then a gun was fired at the
Indians, forcing them to skip nimbly behind
the trees.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>For six long hours the battle kept up at close
quarters. This is what Arnold says about it in
few words: "At half-past twelve the engagement
became general and very warm. Some
of the enemy's ships and all their gondolas
beat and rowed up within musket shot of us.
They continued a very hot fire with round and
grape-shot until five o'clock, when they thought
proper to retire to about six or seven hundred
yards distance, and continued the fire till dark."</p>

<p>Hot as their fire was, they must have found
that of the Americans hotter, for they went
back out of range of the Yankee guns, but kept
within range of their own.</p>

<p>Arnold's vessels were in a bad plight. Several
of them were as full of holes as a pepper
bottle, and one sank soon after the fight ended.
But two of the British gunboats had been sunk
and one blown up. The worst for the Americans
was that nearly all their powder was
gone. They could not fight an hour more.</p>

<p>Perilous as was the situation, Admiral Arnold
was equal to it. The night came on dark
and stormy, with a hard gale from the north.
This was just what he wanted. Up came the
anchors and away went the boats, one after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the other in a long line, each showing a light
to the vessel that followed, but hiding it from
British eyes. In this way they slipped unseen
through the British line, Arnold in the <i>Congress</i>
taking the post of danger in the rear.</p>

<p>When morning dawned the British lookouts
gazed for the American fleet, it was nowhere
to be seen. It had vanished in the night
and now was ten miles down the lake, where
it was drawn up near shore for repairs.</p>

<p>Two of the gondolas proved to be past mending,
and were sunk. The others were patched
up until they could be kept afloat without too
much pumping, and the fleet started on, hoping
to gain the shelter of Crown Point or Ticonderoga.
The wind had changed to the south,
and they had to take to their oars. This kept
them back, but it gave the British quite as much
trouble. That day passed away and the next
day, Friday, dawned before the pursuers came
in sight. And now a chase began with oar
and sail, and continued till noon, when Crown
Point was still some leagues away. By this
time the British cannon balls began to reach
the American boats, and the tired rowers were
forced to turn to their guns and fight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>Never did sea-hero fight more gallantly than
did the soldier Arnold that day. The first
British broadside ruined the gondola <i>Washington</i>
and forced it to surrender. But Arnold
in the little <i>Congress</i> drew up beside the <i>Inflexible</i>,
a 300-ton ship with eighteen 12-pounder
cannon, and fought the ship with his
little gunboat as if they had been of equal
strength. Inspired by his example, the other
boats fought as bravely.</p>

<p>Not until a third of his men were dead and
his boat a mere wreck did he give up the fight.
But not to surrender&mdash;no such thought came
into his mind. By his order the galleys were
run ashore in a creek nearby and there set on
fire. With the three guns of the shattered
<i>Congress</i> he covered their retreat until their
crews were safe on shore.</p>

<p>Then, reckless of the British shot, he ran the
<i>Congress</i> ashore also and stood guard at her
stern while the crew set her on fire. The men
by his orders sought the shore, but Arnold
stood by his flag to the last, not leaving until
the flames had such hold that he was sure no
Briton's hand could strike his flag. It would
float until it went up in flames.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he sprang into the water, waded
ashore, and joined his men, who greeted him
with cheers.</p>

<p>The savages were swarming in the woods,
eager for scalps, but Arnold was not troubled
by fear of them. Forming his men into order,
he marched them through the woods, and
before night reached safety at Crown Point.</p>

<p>Thus ended one of the noblest fights the
inland waters of America ever saw. The
British were victors, though at a heavy cost.
Arnold had fought until his fleet was annihilated;
and not in vain. Carleton sailed back
to St. John's and made his way to Canada. He
had seen enough of Yankee pluck. Thus Arnold,
though defeated, gained by his valor the
fruit of victory, for the British gave up their
plan of holding the lake.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>CAPTAIN PAUL JONES</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Greatest of America's Naval Heroes</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>ONCE upon a time there lived in Scotland a
poor gardener named John Paul, who
had a little son to whom he gave the
same name. The rich man's garden that the
father took care of was close by the sea, and
little John Paul came to love blue water so
much that he spent most of his time near it,
and longed to be a sailor.</div>

<p>He lived in his father's cottage near the sea
until he was twelve years old. Then he was
put to work in a big town on the other side of
the Solway Firth. This town was called
Whitehaven. It was a very busy place, and
ships and sailors were there in such numbers
that the little fellow, who had been put in a
store, greatly liked to go down to the docks
and talk with the seamen who had been in so
many different lands and seas and who could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
tell him all about the wonderful and curious
places they had seen, and about their adventures
on the great oceans they had sailed
over.</p>

<p>In the end the boy made up his mind to go
to sea. He studied all about ships and how to
sail them. He read all the books he could get,
and often, when other boys were asleep or in
mischief, he was learning from the books he
read many things that helped him when he
grew older. At last he had his wish. When
he was only thirteen years old, he was put as a
sailor boy on a ship called the <i>Friendship</i>.</p>

<p>The vessel was bound to Virginia, in America,
for a cargo of tobacco, and the young
sailor greatly enjoyed the voyage and was
especially delighted with the new country
across the sea. He wished he could live in
America, and hoped some day to go there
again.</p>

<p>When this first voyage was over, he returned
to Whitehaven and went back to the
store. But soon after, the merchant who
owned the store failed in business, and the boy
was out of a place and had to look out for himself.
This time he became a real seaman. For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
many years he served as a common sailor. He
proved such a good one that before he was
twenty years old he was a captain. This was
how he became one: While the ship in which
he was sailing was in the middle of the Atlantic
Ocean, a terrible fever broke out. The captain
died. The mate, who comes next to the captain,
died; all of the sailors were sick, and some
of them died. There was no one who knew
about sailing such a big vessel, except young
John Paul. So he took command and sailed
the ship into port without an accident, and the
owners were so glad that they made the young
sailor captain of the ship which he had saved
for them.</p>

<p>John Paul was not the only one of his family
who loved America. He had a brother who
had crossed the ocean and was living in Virginia,
on the banks of the Rappahannock River.
This was the same river beside which George
Washington lived when a boy. The young
captain visited his brother several times while
he was sailing on his voyages, and he liked the
country so much that, when his brother died,
he gave up being a sailor for a while, and went
to live on his brother's farm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>When he became a farmer, he changed his
name to Jones. Why he did so nobody knows.
But he ever after bore the name of John Paul
Jones. He made this one of the best known
names in the history of the seas.</p>

<p>I doubt if he was a very good farmer. He
was too much of a sailor for that. So, when
the American Revolution began, he was eager
to fight the British on the seas. There was no
nation at that time so powerful on the sea as
England. The King had a splendid fleet of
ships of war&mdash;almost a thousand. The United
States had none. But soon the Americans got
together five little ships, and sent them out as
the beginning of the American navy, to fight
the ships of England.</p>

<p>John Paul Jones was made first lieutenant of
a ship called the <i>Alfred</i>. He had the good
fortune to hoist for the first time on any ship,
the earliest American flag. This was a great
yellow silk flag which had on it the picture of a
pine tree with a rattlesnake coiled around it,
and underneath were the words: "Don't tread
on me!"</p>

<p>Then the grand union flag of the colonies
was set. This had thirteen red and white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
stripes, like our present flag, but, instead of
the stars, in the corner it had the British
"union jack." Thus there was a link on the
flag between the colonies and England. They
had not quite cut apart.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 323px;">
<img src="images/i-057.jpg" width="323" height="500" alt="John Paul Jones." title="" />
<span class="caption">John Paul Jones.</span>
</div>

<p>Jones had first been offered the command of
the <i>Providence</i>, a brig that bore twelve guns
and had a crew of one hundred men. But he
showed the kind of man he was by saying that
he did not know enough to be a captain, and
was hardly fit to be a first lieutenant. That
was how he came to be made first lieutenant of
the <i>Alfred</i>. Congress took him at his own
price.</p>

<p>But Commodore Hopkins, who commanded
the fleet, was wise enough to see that Jones
knew more about his work than most of the
captains in the service. So he ordered him to
take command of the <i>Providence</i>, the snug
little brig that had first been offered to him.</p>

<p>The new captain was set at work to carrying
troops and guarding merchant vessels along
the shore, and he did this with wonderful skill.
There were British men-of-war nearly everywhere,
but Jones managed to keep clear of
them. He darted up and down Long Island<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Sound, carrying soldiers and guns and food to
General Washington. So well did he do his
work that Congress made him a captain. This
was on August 8, 1776, a month and more
after the "Declaration of Independence." He
had a free country now to fight for, instead of
rebel colonies.</p>

<p>The <i>Providence</i> was a little vessel, but it was
a fast sailer, and was wonderfully quick to
answer the helm. That is, it turned very
quickly when the rudder was moved. And it
had a captain who knew how to sail a ship.
All this brought the little brig out of more
than one tight place.</p>

<p>I must tell you about one of these escapes, in
which Captain Jones showed himself a very
sharp sea-fox. He came across a fleet of vessels
which he thought were merchant ships,
and had a fancy he might capture the largest.
But when he got close up he found that this
was a big British frigate, the <i>Solebay</i>.</p>

<p>Away went the <i>Providence</i> at full speed, and
hot-foot after her came the <i>Solebay</i>. For four
hours the chase was kept up, the frigate
steadily gaining. At last she was only a hundred
yards away. Now was the time to surrender.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Nearly any one but Paul Jones would
have done so. A broadside from the great
frigate would have torn his little brig to pieces.
But he was one of the "never surrender" kind.</p>

<p>What else could he do? you ask. Well, I
will tell you what he did. He quietly made
ready to set all his extra sails, and put a man
with a lighted match at each cannon, and had
another ready to hoist the union flag.</p>

<p>Then, with a quick turn of the helm, the
little brig swung round like a top across the
frigate's bows. As she did so all the guns on
that side sent their iron hail sweeping across
the deck of the <i>Solebay</i>. In a minute more
the studding sails were set on both sides, like
broad white wings, and away went the <i>Providence</i>
as swift as a racer, straight before the
wind and with the American flag proudly
flying. The officers and men of the frigate
were so upset by the sudden dash and attack
that they did not know what to do. Before
they came to their senses the brig was out of
reach of their shot. Off like a bird she went,
now quite outsailing her pursuer. The <i>Solebay</i>,
fired more than a hundred iron balls after
her, but they only scared the fishes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not long before Captain Jones found
another big British ship on his track. He was
now off the coast of Nova Scotia, and as there
was nothing else to do, he let his men have a
day's sport in fishing for codfish. Fish are
plenty in those waters, and they were pulling
them up in a lively fashion when a strange sail
rose in sight.</p>

<p>When it came well up Captain Jones saw it
was a British frigate, and judged it time to pull
in his fishing lines and set sail on his little craft.
Away like a deer went the brig, and after her
like a hound came the ship. But it soon proved
that the deer was faster than the hound, and so
Captain Jones began to play with the big frigate.
He took in some of his sails and kept
just out of reach.</p>

<p>The <i>Milford</i>, which was the name of the
British ship, kept firing at the <i>Providence</i>, but
all her shot plunged into the waves. It was
like the hound barking at the deer. And every
time the <i>Milford</i> sent a broadside, Paul Jones
replied with a musket. After he had all the
fun he wanted out of the lumbering frigate, he
spread all sail again and soon left her out of
sight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>We cannot tell the whole story of the cruise
of the <i>Providence</i>. In less than two months it
captured sixteen vessels and burned some
others. Soon after that Jones was made captain
of the <i>Alfred</i>, the ship on which he had
raised the first flag. With this he took a splendid
prize, the brig <i>Mellish</i>, on which were ten
thousand uniforms for the British soldiers.
Many a ragged soldier in Washington's army
thanked him that winter for a fine suit of warm
clothing.</p>

<p>Let us tell one more fine thing that Captain
Jones did in American waters before he crossed
the ocean to the British seas. Sailing along
the coast of Canada he came upon a fleet of
coal vessels, with a British frigate to take care
of them. But it was foggy and the coalers
were scattered; so that Jones picked up three of
them while the frigate went on with her eyes
shut, not knowing that anything was wrong.</p>

<p>Two days afterward he came upon a British
privateer, which was on the hunt for
American vessels. But when the <i>Alfred</i> came
up, before more than a few shots had been
fired, down came its flag.</p>

<p>Captain Jones now thought it time to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
home. His ship was crowded with prisoners,
he was short of food and water, and he had
four prizes to look after, which were manned
with some of his crew.</p>

<p>But he was not to get home without another
adventure; for, late one afternoon, there came
in sight the frigate <i>Milford</i>, the one which he
had saluted with musket balls. He could not
play with her now, for he had his prizes to
look after, and while he could outsail her, the
prizes could not.</p>

<p>So he told the captains of the prizes to keep
on as they were, no matter what signals he
made. Night soon came, and the <i>Alfred</i> sailed
on, with two lanterns swinging in her tops.
Soon she changed her course and the <i>Milford</i>
followed. No doubt her captain thought that
the Yankee had lost his wits, to sail on with
lanterns blazing and make it easy to keep in
his track.</p>

<p>But when morning dawned the British captain
found he had been tricked. The <i>Alfred</i>
was in sight, but all the prizes were gone except
the privateer, whose stupid captain had
not obeyed orders. The result was that the
privateer was recaptured. But the <i>Alfred</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
easily kept ahead. That afternoon a squall of
snow came upon the sea, and the Yankee craft,
"amid clouds and darkness and foaming
surges, made her escape."</p>

<p>In a few days more the <i>Alfred</i> sailed into
Boston. There his ship was given another captain,
and for six months he had nothing to do.
Congress was full of politicians who were
looking out for their friends, and the best
seaman in the American navy was left sitting
at home biting his thumb nails and whistling
for a ship.</p>

<p>I have not told you here the whole story of
our greatest naval hero. I have not told you
even the best part of his story, that part which
has made him famous in all history, and put
him on a level with the most celebrated sea
fighters of all time.</p>

<p>The exploits of Paul Jones cover two seas,
those of America and those of England, and
in both he proved himself a brilliant sailor
and a daring fighter. I think you will say this
from what you have already read. His deeds
of skill and bravery on our own coast were
wonderful, and if they had stood alone would
have given him great fame. But it was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the waters and on the shores of England that
he showed the whole world what a man he
was; and now, when men talk of the great
heroes of the sea, the name of John Paul Jones
always stands first. This is the story we have
next to tell, how Captain Jones crossed the
ocean and bearded the British lion in his den.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>HOW PAUL JONES WON RENOWN</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">The First Great Fight of the American Navy</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>YOU have been told how Captain Paul Jones
lost his ship. He was given another in
June, 1777. This was the <i>Ranger</i>, a
frigate carrying twenty-six guns, but it was
such a slow old tub that our captain was not
well pleased with his new craft. He did not
want to run away from the British; he wanted
a ship that was fit to chase an enemy.</div>

<p>We have one thing very interesting to tell.
On the very day that Jones got his new ship
Congress adopted a new flag, the American
standard with its thirteen stars and thirteen
stripes. As soon as he heard of the new flag,
Captain Jones had one made in all haste, and
with his own hands he ran it up to the mast-head
of the <i>Ranger</i>. So she was the first ship
that ever carried the "Stars and Stripes." Is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
it not interesting that the man who first raised
the pine-tree flag of the colonies was the first
to fling out to the breeze the star-spangled flag
of the American Union?</p>

<p>Captain Jones was ordered to sail for France,
but it took so long to get the <i>Ranger</i> ready for
sea that it was winter before he reached there.
Benjamin Franklin and other Americans were
there in France and were having a fine new
frigate built for Paul Jones. But when England
heard of it such a protest was made that
the French government stopped the work on
the ship, and our brave captain had to go to
sea again in the slow-footed <i>Ranger</i>.</p>

<p>He had one satisfaction. He sailed through
the French fleet at <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Quileron'">Quiberon</ins> Bay and saluted
the French flag. The French admiral could
not well help returning his salute. That was
the first time the Stars and Stripes were saluted
by a foreign power.</p>

<p>What Captain Jones proposed to do was the
boldest thing any American captain could do.
England was invading America. He proposed
to invade England. That is, he would cruise
along the British coast, burning ships and
towns, and thus do there what the British had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
done along the American coast. He wanted
to let them find how they liked it themselves.</p>

<p>It was a daring plan. The British channel
was full of war-vessels. If they got on the
track of his slow ship he could not run away.
He would never think of running from one
ship, but there might be a fleet. However,
Paul Jones was the last man in the world to
think of danger; so he put boldly out to sea,
and took his chances.</p>

<p>It was not long before he had all England in
a state of alarm. News came that this daring
American warship was taking prize after
prize, burning some and sending their crews
ashore. He would hide along the English
coast from the men-of-war that went out in
search, and then suddenly dart out and seize
some merchant ship.</p>

<p>The English called Captain Jones a pirate
and all sorts of hard names. But they were
very much afraid of him and his stout ship.
And this voyage of his, along the shores
of England, taught them to respect and fear
the American sailors more than they had ever
done before.</p>

<p>After he had captured many British vessels,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
almost in sight of their homes, he boldly sailed
to the north and into the very port of Whitehaven,
where he had "tended store," as a boy,
and from which he had first gone to sea. He
knew all about the place. He knew how many
vessels were there, and what a splendid victory
he could win for the American navy, if
he could sail into Whitehaven harbor and capture
or destroy the two hundred vessels that
were anchored within sight of the town he
remembered so well.</p>

<p>With two rowboats and thirty men he
landed at Whitehaven, locked up the soldiers
in the forts, fixed the cannon so that they could
not be fired, set fire to one of the vessels that
were in the harbor, and so frightened all the
people that, though the gardener's son stood
alone on the wharf, waiting for a boat to take
him off, not a man dared to lay a hand on
him. With a single pistol he kept back a thousand
men.</p>

<p>Then he sailed across the bay to the house
of the great lord for whom his father had
worked as a gardener. He meant to run away
with this nobleman, and keep him prisoner
until the British promised to treat better the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Americans whom they had taken prisoners.
But the lord whom he went for was "not at
home," so all that Captain Jones's men could
do was to carry off from the big house the
silverware of the earl. Captain Jones did not
like this; so he took the things from his men
and returned them to Earl Selkirk, with a letter
asking him to excuse his sailors.</p>

<p>Not long afterward one of the British men-of-war
which were in the hunt for Captain
Jones, found him. This was the <i>Drake</i>, a
larger ship than the <i>Ranger</i> and carrying more
men. But that did not trouble Paul Jones, and
soon there was a terrible fight. The sails of
the <i>Drake</i> were cut to pieces, her decks were
red with blood, and at last her captain fell
dead. In an hour after the fight began, just
as the sun was going down behind the Irish
hills, there came a cry for quarter from the
<i>Drake</i>, and the battle was at an end. Off went
Captain Jones, with his ship and his prize, for
the friendly shores of France, where he was
received with great praise.</p>

<p>Soon after this the French decided to help
the Americans in their war for independence.
After some time Captain Jones was put in command<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of five ships, and back he sailed to
England to fight the British ships again.</p>

<p>The vessel in which he sailed was the biggest
of the five ships. It had forty guns and
a crew of three hundred sailors. Captain
Jones thought so much of the great Dr. Benjamin
Franklin, who had written a book of
good advice, under the name of "Poor Richard,"
that he named his big ship for Dr. Franklin.
He called it the <i>Bon Homme Richard</i>, which
is French for "good man Richard." But the
<i>Bon Homme Richard</i> was not a good boat,
if it was a big one. It was old and rotten and
leaky, and not fit for a warship, but its new
commander made the best he could of it.</p>

<p>The little fleet sailed up and down the English
coasts, capturing a few prizes, and greatly
frightening the people by saying that they
had come to burn some of the big English sea
towns. Then, just as they were about sailing
back to France, they came&mdash;near an English
cape, called Flamborough Head&mdash;upon an
English fleet of forty merchant vessels and
two war ships.</p>

<p>One of the war ships was a great English
frigate, called the <i>Serapis</i>, finer and stronger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
in every way than the <i>Bon Homme Richard</i>.
But Captain Jones would not run away.</p>

<p>"What ship is that?" called out the Englishman.
"Come a little nearer, and we'll tell
you," answered plucky Captain Jones.</p>

<p>The British ships did come a little nearer.
The forty merchant vessels sailed as fast as
they could to the nearest harbor, and then the
warships had a terrible battle.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock in the evening the British
frigate and the <i>Bon Homme Richard</i> began to
fight. They banged and hammered away for
hours, and then, when the British captain
thought he must have beaten the Americans,
and it was so dark and smoky that they could
only see each other by the fire flashes, he called
out to the American captain: "Are you beaten?
Have you hauled down your flag?"</p>

<p>And back came the answer of Captain John
Paul Jones: "I haven't begun to fight yet!"</p>

<p>So they went at it again. The two ships
were now lashed together, and they tore each
other like savage dogs in a fight.</p>

<p>The rotten old <i>Richard</i> suffered terribly.
Two of her great guns had burst at the first
fire, and she was shot through and through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
by the <i>Serapis</i> until most of her timbers above
the water-line were shot away. The British
rushed on board with pistols and cutlasses, and
the Americans drove them back. But the
<i>Richard</i> was on fire; water was pouring in
through a dozen shot holes; it looked as if she
must surrender, brave as were her captain and
crew. There were on board the old ship nearly
two hundred prisoners who had been taken
from captured vessels, and so pitiful were their
cries that one of the officers set them free,
thinking that the ship was going to sink and
that they ought to have a chance for their
lives. These men were running up on
deck, adding greatly to the trouble of Captain
Jones; for he had now a crowd of enemies on
his own ship. But the prisoners were so
scared that they did not know what to do.
They saw the ship burning around them and
heard the water pouring into the hold, and
thought they would be carried to the bottom.
So to keep them from mischief they were set
to work, some at the pumps, others at
putting out the fire. And to keep the ship
from blowing up, if the fire should reach the
magazine, Captain Jones set men at bringing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
up the kegs of powder and throwing them into
the sea. Never was there a ship in so desperate
a strait, and there was hardly a man on
board, except Captain Jones, who did not want
to surrender.</p>

<p>But the British were not having it all their
own way. The American tars had climbed the
masts and were firing down with muskets
and flinging down hand grenades, until all
the British had to run from the upper deck.
A hand grenade is a small, hollow iron ball
filled with powder, which explodes when
thrown down and sends the bits of iron flying
all around, like so many bullets.</p>

<p>One sailor took a bucketful of these and
crept far out on the yard-arm of the ship, and
began to fling them down on the gun-deck of
the <i>Serapis</i>, where they did much damage.
At last one of them went through the open
hatchway to the main deck, where a crowd of
men were busy working the great guns, and
cartridges were lying all about and loose
powder was scattered on the floor.</p>

<p>The grenade set fire to this powder, and in a
second there was a terrible explosion. A
great sheet of flame burst up through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
hatchway, and frightful cries came from below.
In that dreadful moment more than
twenty men were killed and many more were
wounded. All the guns on that deck had to
be abandoned. There were no men left to
work them.</p>

<p>Where was Captain Jones all the time, and
what was he doing? You may be sure he was
busy. He had taken a gun and loaded it with
double-headed shot, and kept firing at the
mainmast of the <i>Serapis</i>. Every shot cut a
piece out of the mast, and after a while it came
tumbling upon the deck, with all its spars and
rigging. The tarred ropes quickly caught
fire, and the ship was in flames.</p>

<p>At this moment up came the <i>Alliance</i>, one
of Captain Jones's fleet. He now thought that
the battle was at an end, but to his horror the
<i>Alliance</i>, instead of firing at the British ship,
began to pour its broadsides into his own. He
called to them for God's sake to quit firing,
but they kept on, killing some of his best men
and making several holes under water,
through which new floods poured into the ship.
The <i>Alliance</i> had a French captain who hated
Paul Jones and wanted to sink his ship.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Both ships were now in flames, and water
rushed into the <i>Richard</i> faster than the pumps
could keep it out. Some of the officers begged
Captain Jones to pull down his flag and surrender,
but he would not give up. He thought
there was always a chance while he had a deck
under his feet.</p>

<p>Soon the cowardly French traitor quit firing
and sailed off, and Paul Jones began his old
work again, firing at the <i>Serapis</i> as if the battle
had just begun. This was more than the
British captain could bear. His ship was a
mere wreck and was blazing around him, so
he ran on deck and pulled down his flag with
his own hands. The terrible battle was at an
end. The British ship had given up the fight.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Dale sprang on board the
<i>Serapis</i>, went up to Captain Pearson, the British
commander, and asked him if he surrendered.
The Englishman replied that he had,
and then he and his chief officer went aboard
the battered <i>Richard</i>, which was sinking even
in its hour of victory.</p>

<p>But Captain Jones stood on the deck of his
sinking vessel, proud and triumphant. He
had shown what an American captain and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
American sailors could do, even when everything
was against them. The English captain
gave up his sword to the American,
which is the way all sailors and soldiers do
when they surrender their ships or their
armies.</p>

<p>The fight had been a brave one, and the English
King knew that his captain had made a
bold and desperate resistance, even if he had
been whipped. So he rewarded Captain Pearson,
when he at last returned to England, by
making him a Knight, thus giving him the
title of "Sir." When Captain Jones heard of
this he laughed, and said: "Well, if I can meet
Captain Pearson again in a sea fight, I'll make
him a lord."</p>

<p>The poor <i>Bon Homme Richard</i> was such an
utter wreck that she soon sank beneath the
waves. But, even as she went down, the stars
and stripes floated proudly from the mast-head,
in token of victory.</p>

<p>Captain Jones, after the surrender, put all
his men aboard the captured <i>Serapis</i>, and then
off he sailed to the nearest friendly port, with
his great prize and all his prisoners. This
victory made him the greatest sailor in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
whole American war, and the most famous of
all American seamen.</p>

<p>Captain Jones took his prize into the Dutch
port of Texel, closely followed by a British
squadron. The country of Holland was not
friendly to the Americans, and though they
let him come in, he was told that he could not
stay there. So he sailed again, in a howling
gale, straight through the British squadron,
with the American flag flying at his peak.
Down through the narrow Straits of Dover he
passed, coming so near the English shore that
he could count the warships at anchor in the
Downs. That was his way of showing how
little he feared them. The English were so
angry at Holland because it would not give up
the Americans and their prizes that they declared
war against that country.</p>

<p>When Captain Jones reached Paris he was
received with the greatest honor, and greeted
as one of the ablest and bravest of sea-fighters.</p>

<p>Everybody wished to see such a hero. He
went to the King's court, and the King and
Queen and French lords and ladies made much
of him and gave him receptions, and said so
many fine things about him that, if he had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
at all vain, it might have "turned his head," as
people say. But John Paul Jones was not
vain.</p>

<p>He was a brave sailor, and he was in France
to get help and not compliments. He wished
a new ship to take the place of the old <i>Richard</i>,
which had gone to the bottom after its great
victory.</p>

<p>So, though the King of France honored him
and received him splendidly and made him
presents, he kept on working to get another
ship. At last he was made captain of a new
ship, called the <i>Ariel</i>, and sailed from France.
He had a fierce battle with an English ship
called the <i>Triumph</i>, and defeated her. But
she escaped before surrendering, and Captain
Jones sailed across the sea to America.</p>

<p>He was received at home with great honor
and applause. Congress gave him a vote of
thanks, "for the zeal, prudence and intrepidity
with which he had supported the honor of the
American flag"&mdash;that is what the vote said.</p>

<p>People everywhere crowded to see him, and
called him hero and conqueror. Lafayette,
the brave young Frenchman who came over
to fight for America, called him "my dear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Paul Jones," and Washington and the other
leaders in America said, "Well done, Captain
Jones!"</p>

<p>The King of France sent him a splendid reward
of merit called the "Cross of Honor,"
and Congress set about building a fine ship for
him to command. But before it was finished,
the war was over; and he was sent back to
France on some important business for the
United States.</p>

<p>Here he was received with new honor, for
the French knew how to meet and treat a brave
man; and above all they loved a man who had
humbled the English, their ancient foes. Captain
Jones had sailed from a French port and
in a French ship, and they looked on him
almost as one of their own. But all this did
not make him proud or boastful, for he was
not that kind of man.</p>

<p>In later years Paul Jones served in Russia
in the wars with the Turks. But the British
officers who were in the Russian service refused
to fight under him, saying that he was a
rebel, a pirate, and a traitor. This was because
he had fought for America after being
born in Scotland. So, after some hard fighting,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
he left Russia and went back to France,
where he died in 1792.</p>

<p>In all the history of sea fighting we hear of
no braver man, and the United States, so long
as it is a nation, will be proud of and honor the
memory of the gallant sailor, John Paul Jones.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>CAPTAIN BUSHNELL SCARES THE BRITISH</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Pioneer Torpedo Boat and the Battle of the Kegs</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>MANY of us, all our lives, have seen vessels
of every size and shape darting to
and fro over the water; some with sails
spread to the wind, others with puffing pipes
and whirling wheels.</div>

<p>And that is not all. Men have tried to go
under water as well as on top. Some of you may
have read Jules Verne's famous story, "Twenty
Thousand Leagues under the Sea." That, of
course, is all fiction; but now-a-days there are
vessels which can go miles under the water
without once coming to the top.</p>

<p>We call these submarine boats, and look upon
them as something very new. You may be
surprised to learn that there was a submarine
boat as long ago as the War of the Revolution.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
It was not a very good one, and did not do the
work it was built for, but it was the first of its
kind, and that is something worth knowing.</p>

<p>Those of you who have studied history will
know that after the British were driven out of
Boston they came to New York with a large
army, and took possession of that city. Washington
and his men could not keep them out,
and had to leave. There the British lay, with
their army in the city and their fleet in the bay
and river, and there they stayed for years.</p>

<p>There was an American who did not like to
see British vessels floating in American waters.
He knew he could not drive them away, but he
thought he might give them some trouble. This
was a Connecticut man named David Bushnell,
a chap as sharp as a steeltrap, and one of the
first American inventors.</p>

<p>What Bushnell did was to invent a boat that
would move under water and might be made to
blow up an enemy's ship. As it was the first of
this kind ever made, I am sure you will wish to
know what it was like and how it was worked.</p>

<p>He called it <i>The American Turtle</i>, for it
looked much like a great swimming turtle, big
enough to hold a man and also to carry a torpedo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
loaded with 150 pounds of gunpowder.
This was to be fastened to the wooden bottom
of a ship and then fired off. It was expected
to blow a great hole in the bottom and sink
the vessel.</p>

<p>Of course, the boat was air-tight and water-tight,
but it had a supply of fresh air that would
last half an hour for one man. There was an
oar for rowing and a rudder for steering. A
valve in the bottom let in the water when the
one-man crew wanted to sink his turtle-like
boat, and there were two pumps to force the
water out again when he wanted to rise.</p>

<p>There were windows in the top shell of the
turtle, air pipes to let out the foul air and take
in fresh air, small doors that could be opened
when at the surface, and heavy lead ballast to
keep the turtle level. In fact, the affair was,
for the time, very ingenious and complete.</p>

<p>A very important part of it was the torpedo,
with its 150 pounds of powder. This was carried
outside, above the rudder. It was so made
that when the boat came under a vessel the man
inside could fasten it with a screw to the vessel's
bottom, and row away and leave it there.
Inside it was a clock, which could be set to run<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
a certain time and then loosen a sort of gunlock.
This struck a spark and set fire to the
powder, and up&mdash;or down&mdash;went the vessel.</p>

<p>You can see that Dave Bushnell's invention
was a very neat one; but, for all that, luck went
against it. He first tried his machine with
only two pounds of powder on a hogshead
loaded with stones. The powder was set on
fire, and up went the stones and the boards of
the hogshead and a body of water, many feet
into the air. If two pounds of powder would
do all this, what would one hundred and fifty
pounds do?</p>

<p>In 1776 the <i>Turtle</i> was sent out against a
big British ship named the <i>Eagle</i>, anchored in
New York Bay. The man inside rowed his
boat very well under water, and after some
time found himself beneath the King's ship.
He now tried to fasten the torpedo to the bottom,
but the screw struck an iron bar and
would not go in. Then he moved to another
place, but now he lost the ship altogether. He
could not find her again, and he had to row
away, for he could not stay much longer under
water.</p>

<p>There is a funny story told about the man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in the <i>Turtle</i>. He was a queer fellow named
Abijah Shipman, but called by his companions
"Long Bige."</p>

<p>As he entered the craft and was about to
screw down its cover, he opened it again and
asked for a chew of tobacco. All those present
felt in their pockets, but none of the weed was
on hand.</p>

<p>"You will have to go without it, old chap,"
said General Putnam, who was present. "We
Continental officers can't afford even a plug of
tobacco. To-morrow, after you have sent the
<i>Eagle</i> on her last flight, we will try and raise
you a whole keg of the weed."</p>

<p>"That's too bad," growled Bige. "Tell you
what, Gineral, if the old <i>Turtle</i> don't do her
duty, it's all along of me goin' out without
tobacco."</p>

<p>After he had gone Putnam and his officers
watched anxiously for results. Time passed.
Morning was at hand. The <i>Eagle</i> rode unharmed.
Evidently something had gone
wrong. Had the torpedo failed, and was
"Long Bige" resting in his wrecked machine
on the bottom of the bay? Putnam swept the
waters near the <i>Eagle</i> with his glass. Suddenly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
he exclaimed. "There he is." The top
of the <i>Turtle</i> had just emerged, some distance
from the ship.</p>

<p>Abijah, fearing that he might be seen, had
cast off the torpedo that he might go the faster.
The clock had been set to run an hour, and at
the end of that time there was a thundering
explosion near the fleet, hurling up great volumes
of water into the air.</p>

<p>Soon there were signs of fright in the ships.
The anchors were raised, sails were set, and
off they went to safer quarters down the bay.
They did not care to be too near such dangerous
affairs as that.</p>

<p>Boats were sent out to the aid of the <i>Turtle</i>
and it was brought ashore at a safe place. On
landing Abijah gave, in his queer way, the
reasons for his failure.</p>

<p>"It's just as I said, Gineral; it went to pot
for want o' that cud of tobacco. You see, I'm
mighty narvous without my tobacco. When I
got under the ship's bottom, somehow the
screw struck the iron bar that passes from the
rudder pintle, and wouldn't hold on anyhow I
could fix it. Just then I let go the oar to feel
for a cud, to steady my narves, and I hadn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
any. The tide swept me under her counter,
and away I slipped top o' water. I couldn't
manage to get back, so I pulled the lock and
let the thunder-box slide. That's what comes
of sailing short of supplies. Say, can you raise
a cud among you <i>now</i>?"</p>

<p>Later on, after the British had taken the city
of New York, two more attempts were made to
blow up vessels in the river above the city. But
they both failed, and in the end the British
fired upon and sunk the <i>Turtle</i>. Bushnell's
work was lost. The best he had been able to
do was to give them a good scare.</p>

<p>But he was not yet at the end of his schemes.
He next tried to blow up the <i>Cerberus</i>, a British
frigate that lay at anchor in Long Island
Sound. This time a schooner saved the frigate.
A powder magazine was set afloat, but it struck
the schooner, which lay at anchor near the
frigate. The schooner went to pieces, but the
<i>Cerberus</i> was saved.</p>

<p>The most famous of Bushnell's exploits took
place at Philadelphia, after the British had
taken possession and brought their ships up
into the Delaware River.</p>

<p>One fine morning a number of kegs were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
seen floating down among the shipping. What
they meant nobody knew. The sailors grew
curious, and a boat set out from a vessel and
picked one of them up. In a minute it went off,
with the noise of a cannon, sinking the boat
and badly hurting the man.</p>

<p>This filled the British with a panic. Those
terrible kegs might do frightful damage. They
must be some dreadful invention of the rebels.
The sailors ran out their guns, great and small,
and began to batter every keg they saw with
cannon balls, until there was a rattle and roar
as if a mighty battle was going on. Such was
the famous "Battle of the Kegs."</p>

<p>This was more of Dave Bushnell's work.
He had made and set adrift those powder kegs,
fixing them so that they would explode on
touching anything. But he did not understand
the river and its tides. He intended to have
them get among the ships at night, but it was
broad day when they came down, and by that
time the eddying waters had scattered them
far and wide. So the powder kegs were of no
more account than the torpedoes. All they did
was to give the British a scare.</p>

<p>Philadelphia had a poet named Francis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Hopkinson, who wrote a poem making fun of
the British, called "The Battle of the Kegs."
We give a few verses of this humorous poem:</p>

<div class='poem'>
'Twas early day, as poets say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just as the sun was rising;</span><br />
A soldier stood on a log of wood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And saw the sun a-rising.</span><br />
<br />
As in amaze he stood to gaze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(The truth can't be denied, sir),</span><br />
He spied a score of kegs, or more,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Come floating down the tide, sir.</span><br />
<br />
A sailor, too, in jerkin blue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The strange appearance viewing,</span><br />
First "dashed" his eyes in great surprise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then said: "Some mischief's brewing.</span><br />
<br />
"These kegs, I'm told, the rebels hold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Packed up like pickled herring;</span><br />
And they've come down to attack the town<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In this new way of ferrying."</span><br />


*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br />


The cannons roar from shore to shore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The small arms make a rattle;</span><br />
Since wars began, I'm sure no man<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">E'er saw so strange a battle.</span><br />
<br />
The fish below swam to and fro,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Attacked from every quarter.</span><br />
"Why sure," thought they, "the devil's to pay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Mong folks above the water."</span><br />
<br />
From morn to night these men of might<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Displayed amazing courage;</span><br />
And when the sun was fairly down,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Retired to sup their porridge.</span><br />
<br />
Such feats did they perform that day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Against those wicked kegs, sir,</span><br />
That years to come, if they get home,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They'll make their boasts and brags, sir.</span><br />
</div>

<p>And so it went on, verse after verse, with
not much poetry in it, but a good deal of fun.
The British did not enjoy it, for people did not
like to be laughed at then any more than now.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>CAPTAIN BARRY AND HIS ROWBOATS WIN A VICTORY OVER THE BRITISH</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Gallant Naval Hero of Irish Blood</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>THE heroes of our navy were not all
Americans born. More than one of
them came from British soil, but a footprint
on the green fields of America soon
turned them into true-blue Yankees. There
was John Paul Jones, the gallant Scotchman.
And there was John Barry, a bold son of
green Erin.</div>

<p>I have told you the story of Jones, the
Scotchman, and now I must tell you that of
Barry, the Irishman.</p>

<p>John Barry was a merchant captain who
was made commander of the <i>Lexington</i> in
1776. The next year he was appointed to the
<i>Effingham</i>, a new frigate building at Philadelphia.
The British captured that city before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the ship was ready for sea, and the <i>Effingham</i>,
the <i>Washington</i>, and some other vessels were
caught in a trap. They were taken up the
river to Whitehill, above the city, and there
they had to stay. Captain Barry, you may be
sure, was not much pleased at this, for he was
one of the men who love to be where fighting
is going on.</p>

<p>Soon orders came from the Navy Board to
sink the <i>Effingham</i>. This made Barry's Irish
blood very hot. I fancy he said some hard
things about the members of the board, and
swore he would do nothing of the kind. If the
British wanted the American ships let them
come and take them. He had guns enough to
give them some sport and was disposed to
try it.</p>

<p>When the members of the Navy Board
heard of what he said, they were very angry,
and in the end he had to sink the ship and had
to apologize for his strong language. But
time proved that he was right and the Navy
Board was wrong.</p>

<p>By this time Captain Barry was tired
enough of being penned up, and he made up his
mind by hook or crook to get out of his cage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
He was burning for a fight, and thought that
if he could get down the river he might give
the British a taste of his mettle.</p>

<p>So, one dark night he set out with four boats
and twenty-seven men. He rowed down the
river past the ships in the stream and the soldiers
on shore. Some of the soldiers saw his
boats, and a few shots were fired, but they got
safely past, and by daybreak were far down
the broad Delaware.</p>

<p>Barry kept on until he reached Port Penn,
down near the bay, where the Americans had
a small fort. Here there was a chance for the
work he wanted, for across the river he saw
a large schooner flying the British flag. It
was the <i>Alert</i>, carrying ten guns, and with it
were four transports laden with food for the
army at Philadelphia.</p>

<p>This was a fine opportunity for the bold
Irish captain. It took courage to attack a
strong English vessel with a few rowboats,
but of courage Barry had a full supply.</p>

<p>The sun was up, and it was broad day when
the American tars set out on their daring
enterprise. The <i>Alert</i> had a wide-awake name,
but it must have had a sleepy crew; for before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the British knew there was anything wrong,
Barry and his men had rowed across the
stream and were clambering over the rail, cutlass
and pistol in hand.</p>

<p>The British sailors, when they saw this
"wild Irishman" and his daring tars, cutting
and slashing and yelling like madmen, dropped
everything and ran below in fright. All that
keep them there.</p>

<p>In this easy fashion, twenty-eight Americans
captured a British ten-gun vessel with a hundred
and sixteen men on board. There had
been nothing like that in all the war.</p>

<p>The transports had to surrender, for they
were under the guns of the <i>Alert</i>, and Barry
carried his five prizes triumphantly to Port
Penn, where he handed his captives over to
the garrison.</p>

<p>And now the daring captain made things
lively for the foe. He sailed up and down the
river and bay, and cut off supplies until the
British army at Philadelphia began to suffer
for food.</p>

<p>What was to be done? Should this Yankee
wasp go on stinging the British lion? General
Howe decided that this would never do, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
sent a frigate and a sloop-of-war down the
river to put an end to the trouble.</p>

<p>Captain Barry, finding these water-hounds
sharp on his track, ran for Christiana Creek,
hoping to get into shallow water where the
heavy British ships could not follow. But the
frigate was too fast, and chased him so closely
that the best he could do was to run the
schooner ashore and escape in his boats.</p>

<p>But he was determined that they should not
have the <i>Alert</i> if he could help it. Turning
two of the guns downward, he fired through
the ship's bottom, and in a minute the water
was pouring into her hold.</p>

<p>The frigate swung round and fired a broadside
at the fleeing boats; but all it brought back
was a cheer of defiance from the sailors, as
they struck the land and sprang ashore. Here
they had the satisfaction of seeing the schooner
sink before a British foot could be set on her
deck.</p>

<p>The war vessels now went for the transports
at Port Penn. Here a battery had been built
on shore, made of bales of hay. This was attacked
by the sloop-of-war, but the American
sharpshooters made things lively for her. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
might have beaten her off had not their captain
fallen with a mortal wound. The men now lost
heart and fled to the woods, first setting fire
to the vessels.</p>

<p>Thus ended Barry's brave exploit. He had
lost his vessels, but the British had not got
them. The Americans were proud of his daring
deed, and the British tried to win so brave
a man to their side. Sir William Howe offered
him twenty thousand pounds in money and the
command of a British frigate if he would
desert his flag. But he was not dealing now
with a Benedict Arnold.</p>

<p>"Not if you pay me the price and give me
the command of the whole British fleet can you
draw me away from the cause of my country,"
wrote the patriotic sailor.</p>

<p>Barry was soon rewarded for his patriotism
by being made captain of an American frigate,
the <i>Raleigh</i>. But ill-luck now followed him.
He sailed from Boston on September 25, 1778,
and three days afterward he had lost his ship
and was a wanderer with his crew in the vast
forests of Maine.</p>

<p>Let us see how this ill-fortune came about.
The <i>Raleigh</i> had not got far from port before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
two sails came in sight. Barry ran down to
look at them, and found they were two English
frigates. Two to one was too great odds, and
the <i>Raleigh</i> turned her head homewards again.
But when night shut out the frigates she wore
round and started once more on her former
course.</p>

<p>The next day opened up foggy, and till noon
nothing was to be seen. Then the fog lifted,
and to Barry's surprise there were the British
ships, just south of his own. Now for three
hours it was a hot chase, and then down came
another fog and the game was once more at
an end.</p>

<p>But the <i>Raleigh</i> could not shake off the
British bull-dogs. At about nine o'clock the
next morning they came in sight again and the
chase was renewed. It was kept up till late
in the day. At first the <i>Raleigh</i> went so fast
that her pursuers dropped out of sight. Then
the wind failed her, and the British ships came
up with a strong breeze.</p>

<p>At five o'clock the fastest British frigate was
close at hand, and Barry thought he would try
what she was good for before the other
came up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>In a few minutes more the two ships were
hurling iron balls into each other's sides, while
the smoke of the conflict filled the skies. Then
the fore-topmast and mizzen-topgallantmast
of the <i>Raleigh</i> were shot away, leaving her in
a crippled state.</p>

<p>The British ship had now much the best of
it. Barry tried his best to reach and board her,
but she sailed too fast. And up from the south
came the other ship, at swift speed. To fight
them both with a crippled craft would have
been madness, and, as he could not get away,
Barry decided to run his ship ashore on the
coast of Maine, which was close at hand.</p>

<p>Night soon fell, and with it fell the wind.
Till midnight the two ships drifted along, with
red fire spurting from their sides and the
thunder of cannon echoing from the hills.</p>

<p>In the end the <i>Raleigh</i> ran ashore on an
island near the coast. Here Barry fought for
some time longer, and then set his ship on fire
and went ashore with his men. But the British
were quickly on board, put out the fire, and
carried off their prize. Barry and his men
made their way through the Maine woods till
the settlements were reached.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1781 Captain Barry was sent across the
ocean in the <i>Alliance</i>, a vessel which had taken
part in the famous battle of the <i>Bon Homme
Richard</i> and the <i>Serapis</i>. Here the gallant
fellow fought one of his best battles, this time
also against two British ships.</p>

<p>When he came upon them there was not a
breath of wind. All sail was set, but the
canvas flapped against the yards, and the vessel
lay</p>

<div class='center'>
"As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean."<br />
</div>

<p>The British vessels were a brig and a sloop-of-war.
They wanted to fight as badly as did
Captain Barry, and, as they could not sail, they
got out sweeps and rowed up to the American
frigate. It was weary work, and it took them
six hours to do it.</p>

<p>Then came the hails of the captains and the
roar of cannon, and soon there was a very
pretty fight, with the <i>Alliance</i> in a dangerous
situation. She was too heavy to be moved
with sweeps, like the light British vessels, so
they got on her quarters and poured in broadsides,
while she could reply only with a few
guns.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Barry raged like a wild bull, bidding his
men fight, and begging for a wind. As he did
so, a grape-shot struck him in the shoulder and
felled him to the deck. As he was carried
below, a shot carried away the American flag.
A lusty cheer came from the British ships;
they thought the flag down and the victory
theirs. They soon saw it flying again.</p>

<p>But the <i>Alliance</i> was in sore straits. She
was getting far more than she could give, and
had done little harm to her foes. At length a
lieutenant came down to the wounded captain.</p>

<p>"We cannot handle the ship and are being
cut to pieces," he said. "The rigging is in
tatters and the fore-topmast in danger, and the
carpenter reports two serious leaks. Eight or
ten of our people are killed and more wounded.
The case seems hopeless, sir; shall we strike
the colors?"</p>

<p>"No!" roared Barry, sitting bolt upright.
"Not on your life! If the ship can't be fought
without me, then carry me on deck."</p>

<p>The lieutenant went up and reported, and
the story soon got to the men.</p>

<p>"Good for Captain Barry," they shouted.
"We'll stand by the old man."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>A minute later a change came. A ripple of
water was seen. Soon a breeze rose, the sails
filled out, and the <i>Alliance</i> slipped forward and
yielded to her helm.</p>

<p>This was what the brave Barry had been
waiting for. It was not a case of whistling for
a wind, as sailors often do, but of hoping and
praying for a wind. It came just in time to
save the <i>Alliance</i> from lowering her proud
flag, or from going to the bottom with it still
flying, as would have suited her bold captain
the better.</p>

<p>Now she was able to give her foes broadside
for broadside, and you may be sure that her
gunners, who had been like dogs wild to get
at the game, now poured in shot so fast and
furious that they soon drove the foe in terror
from his guns. In a short time, just as Captain
Barry was brought on deck with his
wound dressed, their flags came down.</p>

<p>The prizes proved to be the <i>Atlanta</i> and the
<i>Trepassy</i>. That fight was near the last in the
war. At a later date Captain Barry had the
honor of carrying General Lafayette home to
France in his ship.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>CAPTAIN TUCKER HONORED BY GEORGE WASHINGTON</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Daring Adventures of the Hero of Marblehead</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>CAPTAIN SAMUEL TUCKER was a
Yankee boy who began his career by
running away from home and shipping
as a cabin-boy on the British sloop-of-war
<i>Royal George</i>. It was a good school for a
seaman, and when his time was up he knew
his business well.</div>

<p>There was no war then, and he shipped as
second-mate on a merchant vessel sailing from
Salem. Here he soon had a taste of warlike
life and showed what kind of stuff was in him.
The Mediterranean Sea in those days was infested
by pirates sailing from the Moorish
ports. It was the work of these to capture
merchant ships, take them into port, and sell
their crews as slaves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>On Tucker's first voyage from Salem two
of these piratical craft, swift corsairs from
Algiers, came in sight and began a chase of
the merchantman.</p>

<p>What could be done? There was no hope
to run away from those fleet-footed sea-hounds.
There was no hope to beat them off
in a fight. The men were in a panic and the
captain sought courage in rum, and was soon
too drunk to handle his ship.</p>

<p>Tucker came to the rescue. Taking the
helm, he put it hard down and headed straight
for the pirates. It looked as if he was sailing
straight for destruction, but he knew what he
was about. The Yankee schooner, if it could
not sail as fast, could be handled more easily
than the Algerines, with their lateen sails; and
by skilful steering he got her into such a position
that the pirates could not fire into him
without hurting one another.</p>

<p>Try as they would, Mate Tucker kept his
vessel in this position, and held her there until
the shades of night fell. Then he slipped away,
and by daylight was safe in port. You may
see from this that Samuel Tucker was a bold
and a smart man and an able seaman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>After that he was at one time an officer in
the British navy and at another a merchant
captain. He was in London when the Revolution
began. His courage and skill were so well
known that he was offered a commission in
either the army or the navy, if he was willing
to serve "his gracious Majesty."</p>

<p>Tucker forgot where he was, and rudely replied,
"Hang his gracious Majesty! Do you
think I am the sort of man to fight against my
country?"</p>

<p>Those were rash words to be spoken in London.
A charge of treason was brought against
him and he had to seek safety in flight. For a
time he hid in the house of a country inn-keeper
who was his friend. Then a chance came to
get on shipboard and escape from the country.
In this way he got back to his native land.</p>

<p>It was not only the English who knew Captain
Tucker's ability. He was known in America
as well. No doubt there were many who
had heard how he had served the pirate Moors.
He had not long been home when General
Washington sent him a commission as captain
of the ship <i>Franklin</i>, and ordered him to get to
sea at once.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>The messenger with the commission made
his way to the straggling old town of Marblehead,
where Tucker lived. Inquiring for him
in the town, he was directed to a certain house.</p>

<p>Reaching this, the messenger saw a roughly-dressed
and weather-beaten person working in
the yard, with an old tarpaulin hat on his head
and a red bandanna handkerchief tied loosely
round his neck.</p>

<p>The man, thinking him an ordinary laborer,
called out from his horse:</p>

<p>"Say, good fellow, can you tell if the Honorable
Samuel Tucker lives here or hereabouts?"</p>

<p>The workman looked up with a quizzical
glance from under the brim of his tarpaulin
and replied:</p>

<p>"Honorable, honorable! There's none of
that name in Marblehead. He must be one of
the Salem Tuckers. I'm the only Samuel
Tucker in this town."</p>

<p>"Anyhow, this is where I was told to stop.
A house standing alone, with its gable-end to
the sea. This is the only place I've seen that
looks like that."</p>

<p>"Then I must be the Tucker you want, honorable
or not. What is it you have got to say
to him?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>He soon learned, and was glad to receive the
news. Early the next morning he had left
home for the port where the <i>Franklin</i> lay, and
not many days passed before he was out at sea.</p>

<p>The <i>Franklin</i>, under his command proved
one of the most active ships afloat. She sent in
prizes in numbers. More than thirty were
taken in 1776&mdash;ships, brigs, and smaller vessels,
including "a brigantine from Scotland
worth fifteen thousand pounds."</p>

<p>These were not all captured without fighting.
Two British brigs were taken so near Marblehead
that the captain's wife and sister, hearing
the sound of cannon, went up on a high hill
close by and saw the fight through a spy-glass.</p>

<p>The next year Captain Tucker was put in
command of the frigate <i>Boston</i>, and in 1778 he
took John Adams to France as envoy from the
United States.</p>

<p>It was a voyage full of incidents. They
passed through days of storm, which nearly
wrecked the ship. Many vessels were seen, and
the <i>Boston</i> was chased by three men-of-war.</p>

<p>She ran away from these, and soon after
came across a large armed vessel, which Captain
Tucker decided to fight. When the drum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
called the men to quarters, Mr. Adams seized a
musket and joined the marines.</p>

<p>The captain requested him to go below.
Finding that he was not going to obey, Tucker
laid a hand on his shoulder and said firmly:</p>

<p>"Mr. Adams, I am commanded by the Continental
Congress to deliver you safe in France.
You must go below."</p>

<p>Mr. Adams smiled and complied. The next
minute there came a broadside from the stranger.
There was no response from the <i>Boston</i>.
Other shots came, and still no reply. At length
the blue-jackets began to grumble. Looking
them in the eyes, Tucker said, in quizzical
tones:</p>

<p>"Hold on, lads. I want to get that egg
without breaking the shell."</p>

<p>In a few minutes more, having got into the
position he wished, he raked the enemy from
stem to stern with a broadside. That one sample
was enough. She struck her flag without
waiting for a second. Soon after the envoy
was safely landed in France.</p>

<p>Numbers of anecdotes are told of Captain
Tucker, who was a man much given to saying
odd and amusing things.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Once he fell in with a British frigate which
had been sent in search of him. He had made
himself a thorn in the British lion's side and
was badly wanted. Up came Tucker boldly,
with the English flag at his peak.</p>

<p>He was hailed, and replied that he was Captain
Gordon, of the English navy, and that he
was out in search of the <i>Boston</i>, commanded
by the rebel Tucker.</p>

<p>"If I can sight the ship I'll carry him to New
York, dead or alive," he said.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen him?"</p>

<p>"Well, I've heard of him; they say he is a
tough customer."</p>

<p>While talking, he had been man&oelig;uvering to
gain a raking position. Just as he did so, a
sailor in the British tops cried,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look out below! That is Tucker himself."</p>

<p>The Englishman was in a trap. The <i>Boston</i>
had him at a great disadvantage. There was
nothing to do but to strike his flag, and this he
did without firing a gun.</p>

<p>When Charleston was taken by the British,
the <i>Boston</i> was one of the vessels cooped up
there and lost. Captain Tucker was taken
prisoner. After his exchange, as he had no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
ship, he took the sloop-of-war <i>Thorn</i>, one of
his former prizes, and went out cruising as a
privateer.</p>

<p>After a three weeks' cruise, the <i>Thorn</i> met
an English ship of twenty-three guns.</p>

<p>"She means to fight us," said the captain to
his men, after watching her movements. "If
we go alongside her like men she will be ours
in thirty minutes; if we can't go as men we
have no business there at all. Every man who
is willing to fight go down the starboard gangway;
all others can go down the larboard."
Every soul of them took the starboard.</p>

<p>He man&oelig;uvered so that in a few minutes
the vessels lay side by side. The Englishman
opened with a broadside that did little damage.
The <i>Thorn</i> replied with a destructive fire, and
kept it up so hotly that within thirty minutes a
loud cry came from the English ship:</p>

<p>"Quarters, for God's sake! Our ship is sinking.
Our men are dying of their wounds."</p>

<p>"How can you expect quarters while your
flag is flying?" demanded Captain Tucker.</p>

<p>"Our halliards are shot away."</p>

<p>"Then cut away your ensign staff, or you'll
all be dead men."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>It was done and the firing ceased. A dreadful
execution had taken place on the Englishman's
deck, more than a third of her crew
being dead and wounded, while blood was
everywhere.</p>

<p>And so we take our leave of Captain Tucker.
He was one of the kind of sailors that everyone
likes to read about.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>THE LAST NAVAL BATTLE OF THE REVOLUTION</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Heroic Captain Barney in the "Hyder Ali" Captures the "General Monk"</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>YOU must think by this time that we had
many bold and brave sailors in the Revolution.
So we had. You have not been
told all their exploits, but only a few among
the most gallant ones. There is one more story
that is worth telling, before we leave the Revolutionary
times.</div>

<p>If you are familiar with American history
you will remember that Lord Cornwallis surrendered
to General Washington in October,
1781. That is generally looked on as the end
of the war. There was no more fighting on
land. But there was one bold affair on the
water in April, 1782, six months after the work
of the armies was done.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>This was in Delaware Bay, where Captain
Barry had taken a war vessel with a few rowboats.
The hero of this later exploit was Captain
Joshua Barney, and he was as brave a
man as John Barry.</p>

<p>Captain Barney had seen service through the
whole war. Like John Paul Jones, an accident
had made him a captain of a ship when he was
a mere boy. He was only seventeen, yet he
handled his ship with the skill of an old mariner.
War broke out soon afterward and he
became an officer on the <i>Hornet</i>, though still
only a boy. Soon after he had some lively service
in the <i>Wasp</i>, and captured a British privateer
with the little sloop <i>Sachem</i>.</p>

<p>Then he had some bad fortune, for he was
taken prisoner while bringing in a prize vessel,
and was put on the terrible prison-ship
<i>Jersey</i>. Few of the poor fellows on that vessel
lived to tell the story of the frightful way in
which they were treated. But young Barney
managed to escape, and went to sea again as
captain of a merchant vessel. In this he was
chased by a British war-vessel, the <i>Rosebud</i>.
Shall I tell you the way that Captain Barney
plucked the petals of the <i>Rosebud</i>? He fired<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
a crowbar at her out of one of his cannon.
This new kind of cannon-ball went whirling
through the air and came ripping and tearing
through the sails of the British ship. After
making rags of her sails, it hit her foremast
and cut out a big slice. The Americans now
sailed quietly away. They could laugh at John
Bull's <i>Rosebud</i>.</p>

<p>On the 8th of April, 1782, Captain Barney
took command of the <i>Hyder Ali</i>. This was a
merchant ship which had been bought by the
State of Pennsylvania. It was not fit for a
warship, but the State was in a hurry, so eight
gun-ports were cut on each side, and the ship
was mounted with sixteen six-pounder cannon.
Then she set sail from Philadelphia in charge
of a fleet of merchant vessels.</p>

<p>On they went, down the Delaware river and
bay, until Cape May was reached. Here Captain
Barney saw that there was trouble ahead.
Three British vessels came in sight. One of
these was the frigate <i>Quebec</i>. The others were
a brig, the <i>Fair American</i>, and a sloop-of-war,
the <i>General Monk</i>.</p>

<p>Before such a fleet the <i>Hyder Ali</i> was like a
sparrow before a hawk. Captain Barney at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
once signaled his merchant ships to make all
haste up the bay. Away they flew like a flock
of frightened birds, except one, whose captain
thought he would slip round the cape and get
to sea. But the British soon swallowed up him
and his ship, so he paid well for his smartness.</p>

<p>On up the bay went the other merchantmen,
with the <i>Hyder Ali</i> in the rear, and the British
squadron hot on their track. The frigate sailed
into a side channel, thinking it would find a
short-cut and so head them off. Captain Barney
watched this movement with keen eyes.
The big ship had put herself out of reach for
a time. He knew well that she could not get
through that way, and laid his plans to have
some sport with the small fish while the big fish
was away.</p>

<p>The brig <i>Fair American</i> was a privateer and
a fast one. It came up with a fair breeze, soon
reaching the <i>Hyder Ali</i>, which expected a fight.
But the privateer wanted prizes more than
cannon balls, and went straight on, firing a
broadside that did no harm. Captain Barney
let her go. The sloop-of-war was coming fast
behind, and this was enough for him to attend
to. It had more guns than his ship and they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
were double the weight&mdash;twelve-pounders to
his six-pounders. As the war sloop came near,
Barney turned to his helmsman, and said:</p>

<p>"I want you to go opposite to my orders. If
I tell you to port your helm, you are to put it
hard-a-starboard. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Aye, aye!" answered the tar.</p>

<p>Up came the <i>General Monk</i>, its captain
thinking to make an easy prize, as the <i>Fair
American</i> had been let go past without a shot.
When about a dozen yards away the British
captain hailed:</p>

<p>"Strike your colors, or I will fire!"</p>

<p>"Hard-a-port your helm," roared Barney to
the man at the wheel. "Do you want her to
run aboard us?"</p>

<p>The order was heard on board the enemy,
and the captain gave orders to meet the expected
movement. But hard-a-starboard went
the helm, and the <i>Hyder Ali</i> swung round in
front of the enemy, whose bowsprit caught and
became entangled in her fore-rigging.</p>

<p>This gave the American ship a raking position,
and in a moment the grim tars were hard
at work with their guns. Broadsides were
poured in as fast as they could load and fire,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and every shot swept from bow to stern. The
Englishman, though he had double the weight
of metal, could not get out of the awkward
position in which Barney had caught him, and
his guns did little harm. In less than half an
hour down went his flag.</p>

<p>It was none too soon. The frigate had seen
the fight from a distance, and was making all
haste to get out of its awkward position and
take a hand in the game. Barney did not even
wait to ask the name of his prize, but put a
crew on board and bade them make all haste
to Philadelphia.</p>

<p>He followed, steering now for the <i>Fair
American</i>. But the privateer captain had seen
the fate of the <i>General Monk</i> and concluded
that he had business elsewhere. So he ran
away instead of fighting, and soon ran ashore.
The <i>Hyder Ali</i> left him there and made all
haste up stream. The frigate had by this time
got out of her side channel, and was coming
up under full sail. So Captain Barney crowded
on all sail also and fled away after his prize.</p>

<p>If the frigate had got within gunshot it
would soon have settled the question, for it
could have sunk the <i>Hyder Ali</i> with a broadside.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
But it was not fast enough, and after a
speedy run the victor and her prize drew up
beside a Philadelphia wharf.</p>

<p>Never had the good people of the Quaker
City gazed on such a sight as now met their
eyes. Nothing had been done to remove the
marks of battle. The ships came in as they
had left the fight. Shattered bulwarks, ragged
rents in the hulls, sails in tatters and drooping
cordage told the story of the desperate battle.</p>

<p>And the decks presented a terrible picture.
Blood was everywhere. On the <i>General Monk</i>
were stretched the dead bodies of twenty men,
while twenty-six wounded lay groaning below.
The <i>Hyder Ali</i> had suffered much less, having
but four killed and eleven wounded.</p>

<p>In all the Revolutionary War there have been
few more brilliant actions; and his victory gave
Joshua Barney a high standing among the
naval commanders of the young Republic.</p>

<p>Shall we take up the story of the gallant Barney
at a later date? Thirty years after his victory
over the <i>General Monk</i>, there was war
again between Americans and Britons, and
Commodore Barney, now an old man, took an
active part.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>He started out in the early days of the war
with no better vessel than the schooner <i>Rossie</i>,
of fourteen guns and 120 men. He soon had
lively times. The <i>Rossie</i> was a clipper, and he
could run away from an enemy too strong to
fight, though running away was not much to
his taste.</p>

<p>In his first cruise he was out forty-five days,
and in that time he captured fourteen vessels
and 166 prisoners.</p>

<p>In a month's time he was at sea again. Now
he got among British frigates and had to trust
to the heels of his little craft. But in spite of
the great ships that haunted the seas, new
prizes fell into his hands, one being taken after
an hour's fight. In all, the vessels and cargoes
taken by him were worth nearly $3,000,000,
though most of this wealth went to the bottom
of the sea.</p>

<p>The next year (1813) he was made commodore
of a fleet of gunboats in Chesapeake
Bay. Here for a year he had very little to do.
Then the British sailed up the Chesapeake, intending
to capture Washington and Baltimore,
Barney did not hesitate to attack them, and did
considerable damage, though they were much
too strong for his small fleet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>At length there came from the frightened
people at Washington the order to burn his
fleet, and, much against his will, he was forced
to consign his gunboats to the flames. With
his men, about four hundred in all, he joined
the army assembled to defend the capital.</p>

<p>These sailor-soldiers made the best fight of
any of the troops that sought to save Washington
from capture; but during the fight Commodore
Barney received a wound that brought
his fighting days to an end. Fortunately there
was little more fighting to do, and peace reigned
over his few remaining years of life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE MOORISH PIRATES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Our Navy Teaches Them a Lesson in Honor</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>I &nbsp;&nbsp;SUPPOSE all the readers of this book know
what a pirate is. For those who may not
know, I would say that a pirate is a sea-robber.
They are terrible fellows, these
pirates, who live by murder and plunder. In
old times there were many ship-loads of them
upon the seas, who captured every merchant
vessel they met with and often killed all on
board.</div>

<p>There have been whole nations of pirates,
and that as late as a hundred years ago. By
looking at an atlas you will see at the north of
Africa the nations of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli.
The people of these nations are called
Moors, and they used to be great sea-robbers.
They sent out fast vessels in the Mediterranean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Sea, and no merchant ship there was safe.
Hundreds of such ships were taken and robbed.
Their crews were not killed, but they were sold
as slaves, which was nearly as terrible.</p>

<p>Would you not think that the powerful nations
of Europe would have soon put a stop to
this? They could have sent fleets and armies
there and conquered the Moors. But instead
of that, they paid them to let their ships alone.</p>

<p>Not long after the Revolution these sea-robbers
began to make trouble for the United
States. The new nation, you should know, had
no navy. After it was done fighting with the
British, it was so poor that it sold all its ships.
But it soon had many merchant ships, sailing
to all seas, which were left to take care of themselves
the best way they could.</p>

<p>What did the pirates of Algiers care for this
young nation across the Atlantic, that had rich
merchant ships and not a war vessel to protect
them? Very little, I fancy. It is certain that
they soon began to capture American ships and
sell their sailors for slaves. In a short time
nearly two hundred American sailors were
working as slaves in the Moorish states.</p>

<p>The United States did not act very bravely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Instead of sending out a fleet of warships, it
made a treaty with Algiers and agreed to pay
a certain sum of money every year to have its
vessels let alone. While the treaty lasted, more
than a million dollars were paid to the Dey of
Algiers. If that much had been spent for
strong frigates, the United States would not
have had the disgrace of paying tribute to the
Moors. But the natives of Europe were doing
the same, so the disgrace belonged to them also.</p>

<p>The trouble with the Moors got worse and
worse, and the Dey of Algiers became very
insolent to Americans.</p>

<p>"You are my slaves, for you pay me tribute,"
he said to the captain of an American frigate.
"I have a right to order you as I please."</p>

<p>When the other pirate nations, Tunis and
Tripoli, found that Algiers was being paid,
they asked for tribute, too. And they began to
capture American ships and sell their crews into
slavery. And their monarchs were as insolent
as the Dey.</p>

<p>The United States at that time was young
and poor. It had not been twenty years free
from British armies. But it was proud, if it
was poor, and did not like to have its captains<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and consuls ordered about like servants. So
the President and Congress thought it was time
to teach the Moors a lesson.</p>

<p>This was in 1801. By that time a fleet of
war vessels had been built, and a squadron of
these was sent to the Mediterranean under
Commodore Richard Dale. This was the man
who had been in Paul Jones's great fight and
had received the surrender of the captain of
the <i>Serapis</i>. He was a bold, brave officer, but
Congress had ordered him not to fight if he
could help it, and therefore very little was
done.</p>

<p>But there was one battle, the story of which
we must tell. Commodore Dale had three
frigates and one little schooner, the <i>Enterprise</i>.
All the honor of the cruise came to this little
craft.</p>

<p>She was on her way to Malta when she came
in sight of a low, long vessel, at whose mast-head
floated the flag of Tripoli. When this
came near, it was seen to be a corsair which had
long waged war on American merchantmen.</p>

<p>Before Captain Sterrett, of the <i>Enterprise</i>,
had time to hail, the Moors began to fire at his
ship. He was told not to fight if he could help<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
it, but Sterrett decided that he could not help
it. He brought his schooner within pistol shot
of the Moor, and poured broadsides into the
pirate ship as fast as the men could load and
fire. The Moors replied. For two hours the
battle continued, with roar of cannon and rattle
of muskets and dense clouds of smoke.</p>

<p>The vessels were small and their guns were
light, so that the battle was long drawn out.</p>

<p>At last the fire of the corsair ceased, and a
whiff of air carried away the smoke. Looking
across the waves, the sailors saw that the flag
of Tripoli no longer waved, and three hearty
American cheers rang out. The tars left their
guns and were getting ready to board their
prize, when up again went the flag of Tripoli
and another broadside was fired into their
vessel.</p>

<p>Their cheers of triumph turned to cries of
rage. Back to their guns they rushed, and
fought more fiercely than before. They did not
care now to take the prize; they wished to send
her, with her crew of villains, to the bottom of
the sea.</p>

<p>The Moors fought as fiercely as the Americans.
Running their vessel against the <i>Enterprise</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
they tried again and again to leap on
board and finish the battle with pistol and cutlass;
but each time they were driven back.</p>

<p>The men at the guns meanwhile poured in
two more broadsides, and once more down
came the flag of Tripoli.</p>

<p>Captain Sterrett did not trust the traitors
this time. He bade his men keep to their
guns, and ordered the Tripolitans to bring
their vessel under the quarter of the <i>Enterprise</i>.
They had no sooner done so than a
throng of the Moorish pirates tried to board
the schooner.</p>

<p>"No quarter for the treacherous dogs!" was
the cry of the furious sailors. "Pour it into
them; send the thieves to the bottom!"</p>

<p>The <i>Enterprise</i> now drew off to a good position
and raked the foe with repeated broadsides.
The Moors were bitterly punished for
their treachery. Their deck ran red with blood;
men and officers lay bleeding in throngs; the
cries of the wounded rose above the noise of
the cannon. The flag was down again, but no
heed was paid to that. The infuriated sailors
were bent on sending the pirate craft to the
bottom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>At length the corsair captain, an old man
with a flowing white beard, appeared at the
side of his ship, sorely wounded, and, with a
low bow, cast his flag into the sea. Then Captain
Sterrett, though he still felt like sinking
the corsair, ordered the firing to stop.</p>

<p>The prize proved to be named the <i>Tripoli</i>.
What was to be done with it? Captain Sterrett
had no authority to take prizes. At length
he concluded that he would teach the Bashaw
of Tripoli a lesson.</p>

<p>He sent Lieutenant David Porter, a daring
young officer who was yet to make his mark,
on the prize, telling him to make a wreck of
her.</p>

<p>Porter was glad to obey those orders. He
made the captive Tripolitans cut down their
masts, throw all their cannon and small arms
into the sea, cut their sails to pieces, and fling
all their powder overboard. He left them only
a jury-mast and a small sail.</p>

<p>"See here," said Porter to the Moorish captain,
"we have not lost a man, while fifty of
your men are killed or wounded. You may go
home now and tell this to your Bashaw, and say
to him that in the time to come the only tribute<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
he will get from the United States will be a
tribute of powder and balls."</p>

<p>Away drifted the wrecked hulk, followed by
the jeers of the American sailors, who were
only sorry that the treacherous pirate had
not been scuttled and sent to the bottom of the
sea.</p>

<p>When it reached Tripoli the Bashaw was
mad with rage. Instead of the plunder and the
white slaves he had looked for, he had only a
dismantled hulk.</p>

<p>The old captain showed him his wounds and
told him how hard he had fought. But his
fury was not to be appeased. He had the white-bearded
commander led through the streets
tied to a jackass&mdash;the greatest disgrace he
could have inflicted on any Moor. This was
followed by five hundred blows with a stick.</p>

<p>The Moorish sailors declared that the Americans
had fired enchanted shot. This, and the
severe punishment of the captain of the <i>Tripoli</i>,
so scared the sailors of the city that for a year
after the fierce Bashaw found it next to impossible
to muster a ship's crew. They did
not care to be treated as the men on the <i>Tripoli</i>
had been.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the first lesson which the sailors
of the new nation gave to the pirates of the
Mediterranean. It was the beginning of a
policy which was to put an end to the piracy
which had prevailed for centuries on those
waters.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>THE YOUNG DECATUR AND HIS BRILLIANT DEEDS AT TRIPOLI</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">How Our Navy Began and Ended a Foreign War</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>IN the ship <i>Essex</i>, one of the fleet that was
sent to the Mediterranean to deal with
the Moorish pirates, there was a brave
young officer named Stephen Decatur. He was
little more than a boy, for he was just past
twenty-one years of age; but he had been in the
fight between the <i>Enterprise</i> and the <i>Tripoli</i>,
and was so bold and daring that he was sure
to make his mark.</div>

<p>I must tell you how he first showed himself
a true American. It was when the <i>Essex</i> was
lying in the harbor at Barcelona, a seaport of
Spain. The <i>Essex</i> was a handsome little vessel,
and there was much praise of her in the
town, people of fashion came to see her and
invited her officers to their houses and treated
them with great respect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>Now there was a Spanish warship lying in
the port, of the kind called a xebec, a sort of
three-masted vessel common in the Mediterranean
Sea.</p>

<p>The officers of this ship did not like to see so
much respect given to the Americans and so
little to themselves. They grew jealous and
angry, and did all they could to annoy and
insult the officers of the <i>Essex</i>. Every time one
of her boats rowed past the xebec it would be
challenged and ugly things said.</p>

<p>The Americans bore all this quietly for a
while. One day Captain Bainbridge, of the
<i>Essex</i>, was talked to in an abusive way, and
said little back. Another time a boat, under
command of Lieutenant Decatur, came under
the guns of the xebec, and the Spaniards on
the deck hailed him with insulting words. This
was more than young blood could stand, and
he called to the officer of the deck and asked
him what that meant, but the haughty Spaniard
would give him no satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Decatur. "I will call to
see you in the morning. Pull off, lads."</p>

<p>The next morning Decatur had himself
rowed over to the xebec, and went on board.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
He asked for the officer who was in charge the
night before.</p>

<p>"He has gone ashore," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Decatur, in tones that
every one on board could hear, "tell him that
Lieutenant Decatur, of the frigate <i>Essex</i>, calls
him a cowardly scoundrel, and when he meets
him on shore he will cut his ears off."</p>

<p>There were no more insults after that. Decatur
spoke as if he meant what he said, and the
officers of the xebec did not want to lose their
ears. But the United States Minister to Spain
took up the matter and did not rest until he
got a full apology for the insults to the Americans.</p>

<p>I have told this little story to let you see
what kind of a man Stephen Decatur was. But
this was only a minor affair. He was soon to
make himself famous by one of the most brilliant
deeds in the history of the American navy.</p>

<p>In October, 1802, a serious disaster came to
the American fleet. The frigate <i>Philadelphia</i>
was chasing a runaway vessel into the harbor
of Tripoli, when she got in shoal water and
suddenly ran fast aground on a shelf of rock.</p>

<p>Here was an awkward position. Captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Bainbridge threw overboard most of his cannon
and his anchors, and everything that would
lighten the ship, even cutting down his foremasts;
but all to no purpose. She still clung
fast to the rock.</p>

<p>Soon a flock of gunboats came down the
harbor and saw the bad fix the Americans were
in. Bainbridge was quite unable to fight them,
for they could have kept out of the way of his
guns and made kindling wood of his vessel.
There was nothing to do but to surrender. So
he flooded the powder magazine, threw all the
small arms overboard, and knocked holes in
the bottom of the ship. Then he hauled down
his flag.</p>

<p>The gunboats now came up like a flock of
hawks, and soon the Moors were clambering
over the rails. In a minute more they were in
every part of the ship, breaking open chests
and storerooms and plundering officers and
men. Two of them would hold an officer and
a third rob him of his watch and purse, his
sword, and everything of value he possessed.
The plundering did not stop till the captain
knocked down one of the Moors for trying to
rob him of an ivory miniature of his wife.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the Americans were made to get into
the gunboats and were taken ashore. They
were marched in triumph through the streets,
and the men were thrown into prison. The
officers were invited to supper by the Bashaw,
and treated as if they were guests. But as
soon as the supper was over, they, too, were
taken to the prison rooms in which they were
to stay till the end of the war.</p>

<p>The Tripolitans afterwards got the <i>Philadelphia</i>
off the rocks during a high tide,
plugged up the holes in her bottom, fished up
her guns and anchors, and fitted her up for
war. The Bashaw was proud enough of his
fine prize, which had not cost him a man or a
shot, and was a better ship than he had ever
seen before.</p>

<p>When the American commodore learned of
the loss of the <i>Philadelphia</i> he was in a bad
state of mind. To lose one of his best ships in
this way was not at all to his liking, for he was
a man who did not enjoy losing a ship; and to
know that the Moors had it and were making
a warship of it was a hard thing to bear.</p>

<p>From his prison Captain Bainbridge wrote
letters to Commodore Preble, which the Moors<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
read and then sent out to the fleet. They did
not know that the letters had postscripts written
in lemon-juice which only came out when
the sheet of paper was held to the heat of a fire.
In these the captain asked the commodore to
try and destroy the captured ship.</p>

<p>Commodore Preble was a daring officer, and
was ready enough for this, if he only knew how
it could be done. Lieutenant Decatur was then
in command of the <i>Enterprise</i>, the schooner
which had fought with the <i>Tripoli</i>. He asked
the commodore to let him take the <i>Enterprise</i>
into the harbor and try to destroy the captured
ship. He knew he could do it, he said, if
he only had a chance. At any rate, he wanted
to try.</p>

<p>Commodore Preble shook his head. It could
not be done that way. He would only lose his
own vessel and his men. But there was a way
it might be done. The Moors might be taken
by surprise and their prize burned in their
sight. It was a desperate enterprise. Every
man who took part in it would be in great danger
of death. But that danger did not give
much trouble to bold young Decatur, who was
as ready to fight as he was to eat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>What was the commodore's plan, do you
ask? Well, it was this. Some time earlier the
<i>Enterprise</i> had captured the <i>Mastico</i>, a vessel
from Tripoli. Preble gave this craft the new
name of the <i>Intrepid</i> and proposed to send it
into the harbor. The Moors did not know of
its capture and would not suspect it, and thus
it might get up close to the <i>Philadelphia</i>.</p>

<p>Decatur was made commander and called
for volunteers. Every man and boy on the
<i>Enterprise</i> wanted to go; and he picked out
over seventy of them. As he was about to
leave the deck, a boy came up and asked if he
couldn't go, too.</p>

<p>"Why do you want to go, Jack?"</p>

<p>"Well, Captain, you see, I'd kind o' like to
see the country."</p>

<p>This was such a queer reason that Decatur
laughed and told him he might go.</p>

<p>One dark night, on February 3, 1804, the
<i>Intrepid</i> left the rest of the fleet and set sail
for the harbor of Tripoli. The little <i>Siren</i> went
with her for company. But the weather proved
stormy, and it was not until the 15th that they
were able to carry out their plan.</p>

<p>About noon they came in sight of the spires<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of the city of Tripoli. Decatur did not wish
to reach the <i>Philadelphia</i> until nightfall, but
he was afraid to take in sail, for fear of being
suspected; so he dragged a cable and a number
of buckets behind to lessen his speed.</p>

<p>After a time the <i>Philadelphia</i> came in sight.
She was anchored well in the harbor, under the
guns of two heavy batteries. Two cruisers
and a number of gunboats lay near by. It was
a desperate and dangerous business which Decatur
and his tars had taken in hand, but they
did not let that trouble them.</p>

<p>At about ten o'clock at night the <i>Intrepid</i>
came into the harbor's mouth. The wind had
fallen and she crept slowly along over the
smooth sea. The <i>Siren</i> stayed behind. Her
work was that of rescue in case of trouble.
Straight for the frigate went the devoted crew.
A new moon sent its soft lustre over the waves.
All was still in city and fleet.</p>

<p>Soon the <i>Intrepid</i> came near the frigate.
Only twelve men were visible on her deck. The
others were lying flat in the shadow on the
bulwarks, each with cutlass tightly clutched
in hand.</p>

<p>"What vessel is that?" was asked in Moorish
words from the frigate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"The <i>Mastico</i>, from Malta," answered the
pilot in the same tongue. "We lost our anchors
in the gale and were nearly wrecked.
Can we ride by your ship for the night?"</p>

<p>The permission asked was granted, and a
boat from the <i>Intrepid</i> made a line fast to the
frigate, while the men on the latter threw a
line aboard. The ropes were passed to the
hidden men on the deck, who pulled on them
lustily.</p>

<p>As the little craft came up, the men on the
frigate saw her anchors hanging in place.</p>

<p>"You have lied to us!" came a sharp hail.
"Keep off! Cut those lines!"</p>

<p>Others had seen the concealed men, and the
cry of "Americanos!" was raised.</p>

<p>The alarm came too late. The little craft
was now close up and a hearty pull brought
her against the hull of the large ship.</p>

<p>"Boarders away!" came the stirring order.</p>

<p>"Follow me, lads," cried Decatur, springing
for the chain-plates of the frigate. Men and
officers were after him hot-foot. Midshipman
Charles Morris was the first to reach the deck,
with Decatur close behind.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 324px;">
<img src="images/i-139.jpg" width="324" height="500" alt="Decatur at Tripoli." title="" />
<span class="caption">Decatur at Tripoli.</span>
</div>

<p>The surprise was complete. There was no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
resistance. Few of the Moors had weapons,
and they fled from the Americans like frightened
sheep. On all sides the splashing of water
could be heard as they leaped overboard. In a
few minutes they were all gone and Decatur
and his men were masters of the ship.</p>

<p>They would have given much to be able to
take the noble frigate out of the harbor. But
that could not be done, and every minute made
their danger greater. All they could do was
to set her on fire and retreat with all speed.</p>

<p>Not a moment was lost. Quick-burning material
was brought from the <i>Intrepid</i>, put in
good places, and set on fire. So rapidly did the
flames spread that the men who were lighting
fires on the lower decks had scarcely time to
escape from the fast-spreading conflagration.</p>

<p>Flames poured from the port-holes, and
sparks fell on the deck of the smaller vessel.
If it should touch the powder that was stored
amidships, death would come to them all. With
nervous haste they cut the ropes, and the <i>Intrepid</i>
was pushed off. Then the sweeps were
thrust out and the little craft rowed away.</p>

<p>"Now, lads, give them three good cheers,"
cried Decatur.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Up sprang the jack-tars, and three ringing
cheers were given, sounding above the roar of
the flames and of the cannon that were now
playing on the little vessel from the batteries
and gunboats. Then to their sweeps went the
tars again, and drove their vessel every minute
farther away.</p>

<p>As they went they saw the flames catch
the rigging and run up the masts of the doomed
frigate. Then great bursts of flame shot out
from the open hatchways. The loaded guns
went off one after another, some of them firing
into the town. It was a lurid and striking
spectacle, such as is seldom seen.</p>

<p>Bainbridge and his fellow-officers saw the
flames from their prison window and hailed
them with lusty cheers. The officers of the
<i>Siren</i> saw them also, and sent their boats into
the harbor to aid the fugitives, if necessary.
But it was not necessary. Not a man had been
hurt. In an hour after the flames were seen,
Decatur and his daring crew came in triumph
out of the bay of Tripoli.</p>

<p>Never had been known a more perfect and
successful naval exploit. All Europe talked
of it with admiration when the news was received.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Lord Nelson, the greatest of England's
sailors, said, "It was the boldest and
most daring act of the ages." When the tidings
reached the United States, Decatur, young
as he was, was rewarded by Congress with the
title of captain.</p>

<p>We are not yet done with the <i>Intrepid</i>, in
which Decatur played so brilliant a part. She
was tried again in work of the same kind, but
with a more tragic end.</p>

<p>A room was built in her and filled with
powder, shot, and shells. Combustibles of various
kinds were piled around it, so that it could
not fail to go off, if set on fire. Then, one
dark night, the fire-ship was sent into the harbor
of Tripoli, with a picked crew under another
gallant young officer, Lieutenant Richard
Somers.</p>

<p>They were told to take it into the midst of
the Moorish squadron, set it <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'one'">on</ins> fire and escape
in their boats. It was expected to blow up and
rend to atoms the war vessels of Tripoli.</p>

<p>But the forts and ships began to fire on it,
and before it reached its goal a frightful disaster
occurred. Suddenly a great jet of fire
was seen to shoot up into the sky. Then came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
a roar like that of a volcano. The distant spectators
saw the mast of the <i>Intrepid</i>, with blazing
sail, flung like a rocket into the air. Bombs
flew in all directions. Then all grew dark and
still.</p>

<p>In some way the magazine had been exploded,
perhaps by a shot from the enemy.
Nothing was ever seen again of Somers and
his men. It was the great tragedy of the war.
They had all perished in that fearful explosion.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Now let us turn back to the story of Decatur,
of whom we have some more famous work
to tell.</p>

<p>In August, 1804, the American fleet entered
the harbor of Tripoli and made a daring attack
on the fleet, the batteries, and the city of the
Bashaw. In addition to the war vessels of the
fleet, there were six gunboats and two bomb
vessels, all pouring shot and shell into the city
which had so long defied them.</p>

<p>The batteries on shore returned the fire, and
the gunboats of the Bashaw advanced to the
attack. On these the fleet now turned its fire,
sweeping their decks with grape and canister
shot. Decatur, with three gunboats, advanced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
on the eastern division of the Moorish gunboats,
nine in all.</p>

<p>Decatur, you will see, was outnumbered
three to one, but he did not stop for odds like
that. He dashed boldly in, laid his vessel
alongside the nearest gunboat of the enemy,
poured in a volley, and gave the order to board.
In an instant the Americans were over the bulwarks
and on the foe.</p>

<p>The contest was short and sharp. The captain
of the Tripolitans fell dead. Most of his
officers were wounded. The men, overcome by
the fierce attack, soon threw down their arms
and begged for quarter. Decatur secured them
below decks and started for the next gunboat.</p>

<p>On his way he was hailed from one of his
own boats, which had been commanded by his
brother James. The men told him that his
brother had captured one of the gunboats of
the enemy, but, on going on board after her flag
had fallen, he had been shot dead by the treacherous
commander. The murderer had then
driven the Americans back and carried his boat
out of the fight.</p>

<p>On hearing this sad news, Decatur was filled
with grief and rage. Bent on revenge, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
turned his boat's prow and swiftly sped towards
the craft of the assassin. The instant
the two boats came together the furious Decatur
sprang upon the deck of the enemy. At his
back came Lieutenant McDonough and nine
sturdy sailors. Nearly forty of the Moors
faced them, at their head a man of gigantic
size, his face half covered with a thick black
beard, a scarlet cap on his head, the true type
of a pirate captain.</p>

<p>Sure that this was his brother's murderer,
Decatur rushed fiercely at the giant Moor. The
latter thrust at him with a heavy boarding pike.
Decatur parried the blow, and made a fierce
stroke at the weapon, hoping to cut off its
point.</p>

<p>He failed in this and his cutlass broke off at
the hilt, leaving him with empty hands. With
a lusty yell the Moor thrust again. Decatur
bent aside, so that he received only a slight
wound. Then he seized the weapon, wrested
it from the hands of the Moor, and thrust
fiercely at him.</p>

<p>In an instant more the two enemies had
clinched in a wrestle for life and death, and
fell struggling to the deck. While they lay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
there, one of the Tripolitan officers raised his
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'scimetar'">scimitar</ins> and aimed a deadly blow at the head
of Decatur.</p>

<p>It seemed now as if nothing could save the
struggling American. Only one of his men
was near by. This was a sailor named Reuben
James, who had been wounded in both arms.
But he was a man of noble heart. He could
not lift a hand to save his captain, but his head
was free, and with a sublime devotion he thrust
it in the way of the descending weapon.</p>

<p>Down it came with a terrible blow on his
head, and he fell bleeding to the deck, but before
the Tripolitan could lift his weapon again to
strike Decatur, a pistol shot laid him low.</p>

<p>Decatur was left to fight it out with the giant
Moor. With one hand the huge wrestler held
him tightly and with the other he drew a dagger
from his belt. The fatal moment had arrived.
Decatur caught the Moor's wrist just as
the blow was about to fall, and at the same
instant pressed against his side a small pistol
he had drawn from his pocket.</p>

<p>A touch of the trigger, a sharp report, and
the body of the giant relaxed. The bullet had
pierced him through and he fell back dead.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Flinging off the heavy weight, Decatur rose to
his feet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his few men had been fiercely
fighting the Tripolitan crew. Greatly as they
outnumbered the Americans, the Moors had
been driven back. They lost heart on seeing
their leader fall and threw down their arms.</p>

<p>Another gunboat was captured and then the
battle ended. The attack on Tripoli had proved
a failure and the fleet drew off.</p>

<p>I know you will ask what became of brave
Reuben James, who offered his life for his captain.
Was he killed? No, I am glad to say he
was not. He had an ugly cut, but he was soon
well again.</p>

<p>One day Decatur asked him what reward he
should give him for saving his life. The
worthy sailor did not know what to say. He
scratched his head and looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"Ask him for double pay, Rube," suggested
one of his shipmates.</p>

<p>"A pocket full of dollars and shore leave,"
whispered another.</p>

<p>"No," said the modest tar. "Just let somebody
else hand out the hammocks to the men
when they are piped down. That's something
I don't like."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Decatur consented; and afterwards, when
the crew was piped down to stow hammocks,
Reuben walked among them as free and independent
as a millionaire.</p>

<p>That is all we have here to say about the
Tripolitan war. The next year a treaty of
peace was signed, and Captain Bainbridge and
the men of the <i>Philadelphia</i> were set free from
their prison cells.</p>

<p>In 1812, when war broke out with England,
the gallant Decatur was given the command
of the frigate <i>United States</i>, and with it he
captured the British frigate <i>Macedonian</i>, after
a hard fight.</p>

<p>Poor Decatur was shot dead in a duel in
1820 by a hot-headed officer whom he had offended.
It was a sad end to a brilliant career,
for the American Navy never had a more gallant
commander.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>THE GALLANT "OLD IRONSIDES" AND HOW SHE CAPTURED THE "GUERRIERE"</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Famous Incident of the War of 1812</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>WHEN did our country win its greatest
fame upon the sea? I think, when you
have read the story of the War of
1812, you will say it was in that war. It is
true, we did not do very well on land in that
war, but the glory we lost on the shore we
made up on the sea.</div>

<p>You should know that in 1812 England was
the greatest sea-power in the world. For years
she had been fighting with Napoleon, and every
fleet he set afloat was badly whipped by British
ships. Is it any wonder that the people of that
little island were proud of their fleets? Is it
any wonder they proudly sang&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Britannia needs no bulwarks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">No towers along the steep;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Her march is o'er the mountain waves,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Her home is on the deep."</span><br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>They grew so vain of their lordship of the
sea that they needed a lesson, and they were
to get one from the Yankee tars. As soon as
war began between England and the United
States in 1812, a flock of British war-hawks
came flying bravely across the seas, thinking
they would soon gobble up the Yankee sparrows.
But long before the war was over, they
quit singing their proud song of "Britannia
rules the waves," and found that what they
thought was a Yankee sparrow was the American
eagle.</p>

<p>There were too many great things done on
the ocean in this war for me to name them all,
so I will have to tell only the most famous.
And first of all I must give you the story of the
noble old <i>Constitution</i>, or, as she came to be
called, <i>Old Ironsides</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Constitution</i> was a noble ship of the old
kind. That royal old craft is still afloat, after
more than a hundred years of service, and after
all her companions have long since sunk in the
waves or rotted away. She was built to fight
the French in 1798. She was Commodore
Preble's flagship in the war with the Moorish
pirates. And she won undying fame in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
War of 1812. So the story of the <i>Constitution</i>
comes first in our list of the naval conquerors
of that war.</p>

<p>I fancy, if any of you had been living at that
time, you would have wanted to fight the British
as badly as the Americans then did. For
the British had for years been taking sailors
from American ships and making them serve
in their own men-of-war. Then, too, they had
often insulted our officers upon the seas, and
acted in a very insolent and overbearing way
whenever they had the opportunity. This made
the Americans very angry and was the main
cause of the war.</p>

<p>I must tell you some things that took place
before the war. In 1811 a British frigate
named the <i>Guerriere</i> was busy at this kind of
work, sailing up and down our coast and carrying
off American sailors on pretence that
they were British. Just remember the name
of the "<i>Guerriere</i>." You will soon learn how
the <i>Constitution</i> paid her for this shabby work.</p>

<p>I have also a story to tell about the <i>Constitution</i>
in 1811. She had to cross the Atlantic in
that year, and stopped on some business in the
harbor of Portsmouth, an English seaport.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>One night a British officer came on board and
said there was an American deserter on his
ship, the <i>Havana</i>, and that the Americans could
have him if they sent for him.</p>

<p>Captain Hull, of the <i>Constitution</i>, was then
in London, so Lieutenant Morris, who had
charge of the ship, sent for the man; but when
his messenger came, he was told that the
man said he was a British subject, and therefore
he should not be given up. They were
very sorry, and all that, but they had to take
the man's word for it. Morris thought this
very shabby treatment but he soon had his
revenge. For that very night a British sailor
came on board the <i>Constitution</i>, who said he
was a deserter from the <i>Havana</i>.</p>

<p>"Of what nation are you?" he was asked.</p>

<p>"I'm an American, sor," said the man, with
a strong Irish accent.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Morris sent word to the <i>Havana</i>
that a deserter from his ship was on the <i>Constitution</i>.
But when an officer from the <i>Havana</i>
came to get the deserter, Morris politely
told him that the man said he was an American,
and therefore he could not give him up.
He was very sorry, he said, but really the man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
ought to know to what country he belonged.
You may be interested to learn that Lieutenant
Morris was the man who had been first to
board the <i>Philadelphia</i> in the harbor of Tripoli.</p>

<p>This was paying John Bull in his own coin.
The officers in the harbor were very angry
when they received this answer. Next, they
tried to play a trick on the Americans. Two
of their warships came up and anchored in
the way of the <i>Constitution</i>. But Lieutenant
Morris got up anchor and slipped away to a
new berth. Then the two frigates sailed up
and anchored in his way again. That was the
way matters stood when Captain Hull came on
board in the evening.</p>

<p>When the captain was told what had taken
place, he saw that the British were trying to
make trouble about the Irish deserter. But he
was not the man to be caught by any trick. He
loaded his guns and cleared the ship for action.
Then he pulled up his anchor, slipped round
the British frigates, and put to sea.</p>

<p>He had not gone far before the two frigates
started after him. They came on under full
sail, but one of them was slow and fell far
behind, so that the other came up alone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"If that fellow wants to fight he can have
his chance," said Captain Hull, and he bade his
men to make ready.</p>

<p>Up came the Englishman, but when he saw
the ports open, the guns ready to bark at
him across the waves, and everything in shape
for a good fight, he had a sudden change of
mind. Round he turned like a scared dog, and
ran back as fast as he had come. That was a
clear case of tit for tat, and tat had it. No
doubt, the Englishman knew that he was in the
wrong, for English seamen are not afraid to
fight.</p>

<p>Home from Plymouth came the <i>Constitution</i>
and got herself put in shape for the war that
was soon to come. It had not long begun
before she was off to sea; and now she had a
remarkable adventure with the <i>Guerriere</i> and
some other British ships. In fact, she made a
wonderful escape from a whole squadron of
war vessels. She left the Chesapeake on July
12, 1812, and for five days sailed up the coast.
The winds were light and progress was very
slow. Then, on the 17th, the lookout aloft
saw four warships sailing along close in to the
Jersey coast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Two hours afterward another was seen.
This proved to be the frigate <i>Guerriere</i>, and it
was soon found that the others were British
ships also. One of them was a great ship-of-the-line.
It would have been madness to think
of fighting such a force as this, more than six
times as strong as the <i>Constitution</i>, and there
was nothing to do but to run away.</p>

<p>Then began the most famous race in American
naval history. There was hardly a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'breadth'">breath</ins>
of wind, the sails hung flapping to the masts;
so Captain Hull got out his boats and sent them
ahead with a line to tow the ship. When the
British saw this they did the same, and by putting
all their boats to two ships they got ahead
faster.</p>

<p>I cannot tell the whole story of this race, but
it lasted for nearly three days, from Friday
afternoon till Monday morning. Now there
was a light breeze and now a dead calm. Now
they pulled the ships by boats and now by
kedging. That is, an anchor was carried out
a long way ahead and let sink, and then the
men pulled on the line until the ship was
brought up over it. Then the anchor would be
drawn up and carried and dropped ahead again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>For two long days and nights the chase kept
up, during which the <i>Constitution</i> was kept, by
weary labor, just out of gunshot ahead. At
four o'clock Sunday morning the British ships
had got on both sides of the <i>Constitution</i>, and it
looked as if she was in a tight corner. But
Captain Hull now turned and steered out to
sea, across the bows of the <i>Eolus</i>, and soon had
them astern again.</p>

<p>The same old game went on until four o'clock
in the afternoon, when they saw signs of a
coming squall. Captain Hull knew how to deal
with an American squall, but the Englishmen
did not. He kept his men towing until he saw
the sea ruffled by the wind about a mile away.
Then he called the boats in and in a moment
let fall all his sails.</p>

<p>Looking at the British, he saw them hard
at work furling their sails. They had let all
their boats go adrift. But Captain Hull had
not furled a sail, and the minute a vapor hid
his ship from the enemy all his sails were
spread to the winds and away went the Yankee
ship in rapid flight. He had taught his foes a
lesson in American seamanship.</p>

<p>When the squall cleared away the British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
ships were far astern. But the wind fell again
and all that night the chase kept up. Captain
Hull threw water on his sails and made every
rag of canvas draw. When daylight came only
the top sails of the enemy could be seen. At
eight o'clock they gave up the chase and turned
on their heels. Thus ended that wonderful
three days chase, one of the most remarkable
in naval history.</p>

<p>And now we come to the greatest story in
the history of the "Old Ironsides." In less than
a month after the <i>Guerriere</i> had helped to chase
her off the Jersey coast, she gave that proud
ship a lesson which the British nation did not
soon forget. Here is the story of that famous
fight, by which Captain Hull won high fame:</p>

<p>In the early morning of August 19, while
the old ship was bowling along easily off the
New England coast, a cheery cry of "Sail-ho!"
came from the lookout at the mast-head.</p>

<p>Soon a large vessel was seen from the deck.
On went the Yankee ship with flying flag and
bellying sails. The strange ship waited as if
ready for a fight. When the <i>Constitution</i> drew
near, the stranger hoisted the British flag and
began to fire her great guns.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the <i>Guerriere</i>. When he saw the
Stars and Stripes, Captain Dacres said to his
men:</p>

<p>"That is a Yankee frigate. She will be ours
in forty-five minutes. If you take her in fifteen,
I promise you four months pay."</p>

<p>It is never best to be too sure, as Captain
Dacres was to find.</p>

<p>The <i>Guerriere</i> kept on firing at a distance,
but Captain Hull continued to take in sail and
get his ship in fighting trim, without firing a
gun. After a time Lieutenant Morris came up
and said to him:</p>

<p>"The British have killed two of our men.
Shall we return their fire?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," said Captain Hull. "Wait a
while."</p>

<p>He waited until the ships were almost touching,
and then he roared out:</p>

<p>"Now, boys; pour it into them!"</p>

<p>Then came a roaring broadside that went
splintering through the British hull, doing
more damage than all the <i>Guerriere's</i> fire.</p>

<p>Now the battle was on in earnest. The two
ships lay side by side, and for fifteen minutes
the roar of cannon and the rattle of musketry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
filled the air, while cannon balls tore their way
through solid timber and human flesh.</p>

<p>Down came the mizzen-mast of the <i>Guerriere</i>,
cut through by a big iron shot.</p>

<p>"Hurrah, boys!" cried Hull, swinging his
hat like a schoolboy; "we've made a brig of
her."</p>

<p>The mast dragged by its ropes and brought
the ship round, so that the next broadside
from the <i>Constitution</i> raked her from stem to
stern.</p>

<p>The bowsprit of the <i>Guerriere</i> caught fast
in the rigging of the <i>Constitution</i>, and the
sailors on both ships tried to board. But soon
the winds pulled the <i>Constitution</i> clear, and as
she forged ahead, down with a crash came the
other masts of the British ship. They had
been cut into splinters by the Yankee guns. A
few minutes before she had been a stately
three-masted frigate; now she was a helpless
hulk. Not half an hour had passed since the
<i>Constitution</i> fired her first shot, and already
the <i>Guerriere</i> was a wreck, while the Yankee
ship rode the waters as proudly as ever.</p>

<p>Off in triumph went the "Old Ironsides," and
hasty repairs to her rigging were made. Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
she came up with loaded guns. The <i>Guerriere</i>
lay rolling like a log in the water, without
a flag in sight. Not only her masts were
gone, but her hull was like a sieve. It had
more than thirty cannon-ball holes below the
water-line.</p>

<p>There was no need to fire again. Lieutenant
Read went off in a boat.</p>

<p>"Have you surrendered?" he asked Captain
Dacres, who was looking, with a very long
face, over the rail.</p>

<p>"It would not be prudent to continue the engagement
any longer," said Dacres, in gloomy
tones.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you have struck your
flag?"</p>

<p>"Not precisely. But I do not know that it
will be worth while to fight any more."</p>

<p>"If you cannot make up your mind I will go
back and we will do something to help you."</p>

<p>"I don't see that I can keep up the fight,"
said the dejected British captain. "I have
hardly any men left and my ship is ready to
sink."</p>

<p>"What I want to know is," cried Lieutenant
Read, "whether you are a prisoner of war or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
an enemy. And I must know without further
parley."</p>

<p>"If I could fight longer I would," said Captain
Dacres. Then with faltering words he
continued, "but-I-must-surrender."</p>

<p>"Then accept from me Captain Hull's compliments.
He wishes to know if you need the
aid of a surgeon or surgeon's mate."</p>

<p>"Have you not business enough on your own
ship for all your doctors?" asked Dacres.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" said Read. "We have only seven
men wounded, and their wounds are all
dressed."</p>

<p>Captain Dacres was obliged to enter Read's
boat and be rowed to the <i>Constitution</i>. He had
been wounded, and could not climb very well,
so Captain Hull helped him to the deck.</p>

<p>"Give me your hand, Dacres," he said, "I
know you are hurt."</p>

<p>Captain Dacres offered his sword, but the
American captain would not take it.</p>

<p>"No, no," he said, "I will not take a sword
from one who knows so well how to use it. But
I'll trouble you for that hat."</p>

<p>What did he mean by that, you ask? Well,
the two captains had met some time before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
war, and Dacres had offered to bet a hat that
the <i>Guerriere</i> would whip the <i>Constitution</i>.
Hull accepted the bet, and he had won.</p>

<p>All day and night the boats were kept busy
in carrying the prisoners, well and hurt, to the
<i>Constitution</i>. When daylight came again it
was reported that the <i>Guerriere</i> was filling with
water and ready to sink.</p>

<p>She could not be saved, so she was set on
fire. Rapidly the flames spread until they
reached her magazine. Then came a fearful
explosion, and a black cloud of smoke hung
over the place where the ship had floated.
When it moved away only some floating planks
were to be seen. The proud <i>Guerriere</i> would
never trouble Yankee sailors again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>A FAMOUS VESSEL SAVED BY A POEM</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">"Old Ironsides" Wins New Glory</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>"<i>OLD IRONSIDES</i> was a noble old ship,
and a noble old ship was she." Come,
I know you have not heard enough
about this grand old ship, so let us go on with
her story. And the first thing to tell is how she
served another British ship as she had served
the <i>Guerriere</i>.</div>

<p>Four months after Captain Hull's great victory,
the <i>Constitution</i> was in another sea and
had another captain. She had sailed south
and was now off the coast of Brazil. And
William Bainbridge had succeeded Isaac Hull
in command.</p>

<p>It was almost the last day of the year.
Chilly weather, no doubt, in Boston from which
she had sailed; but mid-summer warmth in
those southern waters. It certainly felt warm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
enough to the men on deck, who were "spoiling
for a fight," when the lookout aloft announced
two sails.</p>

<p>The sailors who had been lounging about the
deck sprang up and looked eagerly across the
waves, as the cheerful "Sail-ho!" reached their
ears. Soon they saw that one of the vessels
was coming their way as fast as her sails could
carry her. The other had sailed away on the
other tack.</p>

<p>The vessel that was coming was the <i>Java</i>,
a fine British frigate. As she drew near she
showed signals. That is, she spread out a
number of small flags, each of which had some
meaning, and by which British ships could talk
with each other. Captain Bainbridge could
not answer these, for he did not know what
they meant. So he showed American signals,
which the captain of the <i>Java</i> could not understand
any better.</p>

<p>Then, as they came nearer, they hoisted their
national flags, and both sides saw that they
were enemies and that a fight was on hand.</p>

<p>Captain Bainbridge was not like Captain
Hull. He did not wait till the ships were side
by side, but began firing when the <i>Java</i> was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
half a mile away. That was only wasting
powder and balls, but they kept on firing until
they were close at hand, and then the shots
began to tell.</p>

<p>A brave old fellow was the captain of the
<i>Constitution</i>. A musket ball struck him in the
thigh as he was pacing the deck. He stopped
his pacing, but would not go below. Then a
copper bolt went deep into his leg. But he had
it cut out and the leg tied up, and he still kept
on deck. He wanted to see the fight.</p>

<p>Hot and fierce came the cannon balls,
hurtling through sails and rigging, rending
through thick timbers, and sending splinters
flying right and left. Men fell dead and blood
ran in streams, but still came the heralds of
death.</p>

<p>We must tell the same story of this fight as
of the fight with the <i>Guerriere</i>. The British
did not know how to aim their guns and the
Americans did. The British had no sights on
their cannon and the Americans had. That
was why, all through the war, the British lost
so heavily and the Americans so little. The
British shot went wild and the American balls
flew straight to their mark.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>You know what must come from that. After
while, off went the <i>Java's</i> bowsprit, as if it had
been chopped off with a great knife. Five
minutes later her foremast was cut in two and
came tumbling down. Then the main topmast
crashed down from above. Last of all, her
mizzen-mast was cut short off by the plunging
shot, and fell over the side. The well-aimed
American balls had cut through her great
spars, as you might cut through a willow stick,
and she was dismantled as the <i>Guerriere</i> had
been.</p>

<p>The loud "hurrahs" of the Yankee sailors
proved enough to call the dead to life. At any
rate, a wounded man, whom everyone thought
dead, opened his eyes and asked what they were
cheering about.</p>

<p>"The enemy has struck," he was told.</p>

<p>The dying tar lifted himself on one arm,
and waved the other round his head, and gave
three feeble cheers. With the last one he fell
back dead.</p>

<p>But the <i>Java's</i> flag was not down for good.
As the <i>Constitution</i> came up with all masts
standing and sails set, the British flag was
raised to the stump of the mizzen-mast. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
he saw this, Bainbridge wore his ship to give
her another broadside, and then down came her
flag for good. She had received all the battering
she could stand. In fact, the <i>Constitution</i>
had lost only 34 men, killed and wounded, while
the Java had lost 150 men. The <i>Constitution</i>
was sound and whole; the <i>Java</i> had only her
mainmast left and was full of yawning rents.
<i>Old Ironsides</i> had a new feather in her cap.</p>

<p>Like the <i>Guerriere</i>, the <i>Java</i> was hurt past
help. It was impossible to take her home; so
on the last day of 1812, the torch was put to
her ragged timbers and the flames took hold.
Quickly they made their way through the
ruined ship. About three o'clock in the afternoon
they reached her magazine, and with a
mighty roar the wreck of the British ship was
torn into fragments. To the bottom went the
hull. Only the broken masts and a few shattered
timbers remained afloat.</p>

<p>Such is war: a thing of ruin and desolation.
Of that gallant ship, which two days before
had been proudly afloat, only some smoke-stained
fragments were left to tell that she had
ever been on the seas, and death and wounds
had come to many of her men.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>After her fight with the <i>Java</i> the <i>Constitution</i>
had a long, weary rest. You will remember
the <i>Bon Homme Richard</i>, a rotten old hulk
not fit for fighting, though she made a very
good show when the time for fighting came.
The <i>Constitution</i> was much like her; so rotten
in her timbers that she had to be brought home
and rebuilt.</p>

<p>Then she went a-sailing again, under Captain
Charles Stewart, as good an officer as Hull
and Bainbridge; but it was more than two
years after her last battle before she had another
chance to show what sort of a fighter
she was.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that some of the hardest
fights of this war with England took place
after the war was at an end. The treaty of
peace was signed on Christmas eve, 1814, but
the great battle at New Orleans was fought
two weeks afterward. There were no ocean
cable then to send word to the armies that all
their killing was no longer needed, since there
was nothing to fight about.</p>

<p>It was worse still for the ships at sea. Nobody
then had ever dreamed of a telegraph
without wires to send word out over the waste<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of waters, or even of a telegraph with wires.
Thus it was that the last battle of the old
<i>Constitution</i> was fought nearly two months
after the war was over.</p>

<p>The good old ship was then on the other side
of the ocean, and was sailing along near the
island of Madeira, which lies off the coast of
Africa. For a year she had done nothing except
to take a few small prizes, and her stalwart
crew were tired of that sort of work.
They wanted a real, big fight, with plenty of
glory.</p>

<p>One evening Captain Stewart heard some of
the officers talking about their bad luck, and
wishing they could only meet with a fellow of
their own size. They were tired of fishing for
minnows when there were whales to be caught.</p>

<p>"I can tell you this, gentlemen," said the
captain, "you will soon get what you want.
Before the sun rises and sets again you will
have a good old-fashioned fight, and it will not
be with a single ship, either."</p>

<p>I do not know what the officers said after
the captain turned away. Very likely some of
them wondered how he came to be a prophet
and could tell what was going to take place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
I doubt very much whether they believed what
he had said.</p>

<p>At any rate, about one o'clock the next day,
February 20, 1815, when the ship was gliding
along before a light breeze, a sail was seen far
away in front. An hour later a second sail was
made out, close by the first. And when the
<i>Constitution</i> got nearer it was seen that they
were both ships-of-war. It began to look as if
Captain Stewart was a good prophet, after all.</p>

<p>It turned out that the first of these was the
small British frigate <i>Cyane</i>. The second was
the sloop-of-war <i>Levant</i>. Neither was a match
by itself for the <i>Constitution</i>, but both together
they thought themselves a very good match.</p>

<p>It was five o'clock before the Yankee ship
came up within gunshot. The two British
ships had closed together so as to help one another,
and now they all stripped off their extra
sails, as a man takes off his coat and vest for a
fight.</p>

<p>Six o'clock passed before the battle began.
Then for fifteen minutes the three ships hurled
their iron balls as fast as the men could load
and fire. By that time the smoke was so thick
that they had to stop firing to find out where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the two fighting ships were. The <i>Constitution</i>
now found herself opposite the <i>Levant</i> and
poured a broadside into her hull. Then she
sailed backward&mdash;a queer thing to do, but Captain
Stewart knew how to move his ship stern
foremost&mdash;and poured her iron hail into the
<i>Cyane</i>. Next she pushed ahead again and
pounded the <i>Levant</i> till that lively little craft
turned and ran. It had enough of the <i>Constitution's</i>
iron dumplings to last a while.</p>

<p>This was great sailing and great firing, but
Captain Stewart was one of those seamen who
know how <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'a'">to</ins> handle a ship, and his men knew
how to handle their guns. There were never
better seamen than those of the <i>Old Ironsides</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Levant</i> was now out of the way, and
there was only the <i>Cyane</i> to attend to. Captain
Stewart attended to her so well that, just
forty minutes after the fight began, her flag
came down.</p>

<p>Where, now, was the <i>Levant</i>? She had run
out of the fight; but she had a brave captain
who did not like to desert his friend, so he
turned back and came gallantly up again.</p>

<p>It was a noble act, but a foolish one. This
the British captain found out when he came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
once more under the American guns. They
were much too hot for him, and once more he
tried to run away. He did not succeed this
time. Captain Stewart was too much in love
with him to let him go, and sent such warm
love-letters after him that his flag came gliding
down, as his comrade's had done.</p>

<p>Captain Stewart had shown himself a true
prophet. He had met, fought with, and won
two ships of the enemy. No doubt after that
his officers were sure they had a prophet for a
captain.</p>

<p>That evening, when the two British captains
were in the cabin of the <i>Constitution</i>, a midshipman
came down and asked Captain Stewart
if the men could not have their grog.</p>

<p>"Why, didn't they have it?" asked the captain.
"It was time for it before the battle
began."</p>

<p>"It was mixed for them, sir," said the midshipman,
"but our old men said they didn't
want any 'Dutch courage,' so they emptied the
grog-tub into the lee scuppers."</p>

<p>The Englishmen stared when they heard
this. It is very likely their men had not fought
without a double dose of grog.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>We have not finished our story yet. Like a
lady's letter, it has a postscript. On March
10, the three ships were in a harbor of the
Cape de Verde Islands, and Captain Stewart
was sending his prisoners ashore, when three
large British men-of-war were seen sailing
into the harbor.</p>

<p>Stewart was nearly caught in a trap. Any
one of these large frigates was more than a
match for the <i>Constitution</i>, and here were
three in a bunch. But, by good luck, there
was a heavy fog that hid everything but
the highest sails; so there was a chance of
escape.</p>

<p>Captain Stewart was not the man to be
trapped while a chance was left. He was what
we call a "wide-awake." There was a small
chance left. He cut his cable, made a signal to
the prize vessels to do the same, and in ten
minutes after the first British vessel had been
seen, the American ship and its prizes were
gliding swiftly away.</p>

<p>On came the British ships against a stiff
breeze, up the west side of the bay. Out slipped
the Yankee ships along the east side. Captain
Stewart set no sails higher than his top sails,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and these were hidden by the fog, so the British
lookouts saw nothing. They did not dream
of the fine birds that were flying away.</p>

<p>Only when Stewart got his ship past the
outer point of the harbor did he spread his
upper sails to the breeze, and the British lookouts
saw with surprise a cloud of canvas suddenly
bursting out upon the air.</p>

<p>Now began a close chase. The <i>Constitution</i>
and her prizes had only about a mile the start.
As quick as the British ships could turn they
were on their track. But those were not the
days of the great guns that can send huge balls
six or seven miles through the air. A mile then
was a long shot for the largest guns, and the
Yankee cruisers had made a fair start.</p>

<p>But before they had gone far Captain Stewart
saw that the <i>Cyane</i> was in danger of being
taken, and signaled for her to tack and take
another course. She did so and sailed safely
away. For three hours the three big frigates
hotly chased the <i>Constitution</i> and <i>Levant</i>, but
let the <i>Cyane</i> go.</p>

<p>Captain Stewart now saw that the <i>Levant</i>
was in the same danger, and he sent her a
signal to tack as the <i>Cyane</i> had done. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
<i>Levant</i> tacked and sailed out of the line of the
chase.</p>

<p>What was the surprise of the Yankee captain
and his men when they saw all three of
the big British ships turn on their heels and set
sail after the little sloop-of-war, letting the
<i>Constitution</i> sail away. It was like three great
dogs turning to chase a rabbit and letting a
deer run free.</p>

<p>The three huge monsters chased the little
<i>Levant</i> back into the island port, and there for
fifteen minutes they fired broadsides at her.
The prisoners whom Captain Stewart had
landed did the same from a battery on shore.
And yet not a shot struck her hull; they were
all wasted in the air.</p>

<p>At length Lieutenant Bullard, who was
master of the prize, hauled down his flag. He
thought he had seen enough fun, and they
might hurt somebody afterwhile if they kept
on firing. But what was the chagrin of the
British captains to find that all they had done
was to take back one of their own vessels, while
the American frigate had gone free.</p>

<p>The <i>Constitution</i> and the <i>Cyane</i> got safely
to the American shores, where their officers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
learned that the war had ceased more than
three months before. But the country was
proud of their good service, and Congress gave
medals of honor to Stewart and his officers.</p>

<p>That was the last warlike service of the gallant
<i>Old Ironsides</i>, the most famous ship of the
American Navy. Years passed by and her
timbers rotted away, as they had done once
before. Some of the wise heads in the Navy
Department, men without a grain of sentiment,
decided that she was no longer of any use and
should be broken up for old timber.</p>

<p>But if they had no love for the good old ship,
there were those who had; and a poet, Oliver
Wendell Holmes, came to the rescue. This is
the poem by which he saved the ship:</p>

<div class='center'>THE OLD IRONSIDES.</div>

<div class='poem'>
Ay, tear her tattered ensign down!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Long has it waved on high,</span><br />
And many an eye has danced to see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That banner in the sky;</span><br />
Beneath it rung the battle shout,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And burst the cannon's roar;</span><br />
The meteor of the ocean air<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall sweep the clouds no more!</span><br />
<br />
Her deck, once red with heroes' blood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where knelt the vanquished foe,</span><br />
When winds were hurrying o'er the flood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And waves were white below,</span><br />
No more shall feel the victor's tread<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or know the conquered knee;</span><br />
The harpies of the shore shall pluck<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The eagle of the sea!</span><br />
<br />
O! better that her shattered hulk<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should sink beneath the wave;</span><br />
Her thunders shook the mighty deep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And there should be her grave;</span><br />
Nail to the mast her holy flag,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Set every threadbare sail,</span><br />
And give her to the god of storms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The lightning and the gale.</span><br />
</div>

<p>There was no talk of destroying the <i>Old
Ironsides</i> after that. The man that did it
would have won eternal disgrace. She still
floats, and no doubt she will float, as long as
two of her glorious old timbers hang together.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>THE FIGHT OF CAPTAIN JACOB JONES</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Lively Little "Wasp" and How She Stung the "Frolic"</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>NO doubt most of my readers know very
well what a wasp is and how nicely it
can take care of itself. When I was a
boy I found out more than once how long and
sharp a sting it has, and I do not think many
boys grow up without at some time waking up
a wasp and wishing they had left it asleep.</div>

<p>The United States has had three <i>Wasps</i> and
one <i>Hornet</i> in its navy, and the British boys
who came fooling in their way found that all
of them could sting. I will tell you about the
time one of our <i>Wasps</i> met the British <i>Frolic</i>
and fought it in a great gale, when the ships
were tossing about like chips on the ocean
billows.</p>

<p>Not long after the <i>Constitution</i> had her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
great fight with the <i>Guerriere</i>, a little sloop-of-war
named the <i>Wasp</i> set sail from Philadelphia
to see what she could find on the broad
seas. This vessel, you should know, had three
masts and square sails like a ship. But she
was not much larger than one of the sloops we
see on our rivers to-day, so it was right to call
her a sloop. For captain she had a bold sailor
named Jacob Jones.</p>

<p>The first thing the <i>Wasp</i> found at sea was
a mighty gale of wind, that blew "great guns"
for two days. The waves were so big and
fierce that one of them carried away her bowsprit
with two men on it. The next night, after
the wind had gone down a little, lights shone
out across the waves, and when daylight came
Captain Jones saw over the heaving billows six
large merchant ships. With them was a
watch-dog in the shape of a fighting brig.</p>

<p>This brig was named the <i>Frolic</i>. It had been
sent in charge of a fleet of fourteen merchantmen,
but these had been scattered by the gale
until only six were left. The <i>Frolic</i> was a good
match for the <i>Wasp</i>, and seemed to want a
fight quite as badly, for it sailed for the American
ship as fast as the howling wind would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
let it. And you may be sure the <i>Wasp</i> did not
fly away.</p>

<p>Captain Jones hoisted his country's flag like
a man. He was not afraid to show his true
colors. But the <i>Frolic</i> came up under the
Spanish flag. When they got close together
Captain Jones hailed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What ship is that?"</p>

<p>The only answer of the British captain was
to pull down the Spanish flag and run up his
own standard, stamped with the red cross of
St. George. And as the one flag went down
and the other went up, the <i>Frolic</i> fired a broadside
at the <i>Wasp</i>. But just then the British
ship rolled over on the side of a wave, and its
balls went whistling upward through the air.
The Yankee gunners were more wide-awake
than that. They waited until their vessel rolled
down on the side of a great billow, and then
they fired, their solid shot going low, and tearing
into the <i>Frolic's</i> sides.</p>

<p>The fighting went that way all through the
battle. The British gunners did not know their
business and fired wild. The Yankees knew
what they were about, and made every shot
tell. They had sights on their guns and took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
aim; the British had no sights and took no aim.
That is why the Americans were victors in so
many fights.</p>

<p>But I think there was not often a sea-fight
like this. The battle took place off Cape Hatteras,
which is famous for its storms. The
wind whistled and howled; the waves rose into
foaming crests and sank into dark hollows;
the fighting craft rolled and pitched. As they
rolled upward the guns pointed at the clouds.
As they rolled downward the muzzles of the
guns often dipped into the foam. Great masses
of spray came flying over the bulwarks,
sweeping the decks. The weather and the
sailors both had their blood up, and both were
fighting for all they were worth. It was a
question which would win, the wind or the
men.</p>

<p>As fast as the smoke rose the wind swept it
away, so that the gunners had a clear view of
the ships. The roar of the gale was half
drowned by the thunder of the guns, and the
whistle of the wind mingled with the scream of
the balls, while the sailors shouted as they ran
out their guns and cheered as the iron hail
swept across the waves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>In such frantic haste did the British handle
their guns, that they fired three shots to the
Yankees' two. The latter did not fire till they
saw something to fire at. As a result, most of
British balls went whistling overhead, and
pitching over the <i>Wasp</i> into the sea, while most
of the Yankee balls swept the decks or bored
into the timbers of the <i>Frolic</i>.</p>

<p>But you must not think that the shots of the
<i>Frolic</i> were all wasted, if they did go high.
One of them hit the maintopmast of the <i>Wasp</i>
and cut it square off. Another hit the mizzen-topgallantmast
and toppled it into the waves.
In twenty minutes from the start "every brace
and most of the rigging of the <i>Wasp</i> were shot
away." The <i>Wasp</i> had done little harm above,
but a great deal below.</p>

<p>The <i>Frolic</i> could have run away now if she
had wanted to. But her captain was not of
the runaway kind. The fire of the <i>Wasp</i> had
covered his deck with blood, but he fought
boldly on.</p>

<p>As they fought the two ships drifted together
and soon their sides met with a crash.
Then, as they were swept apart by the waves,
two of the <i>Wasp's</i> guns were fired into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
bow-ports of the <i>Frolic</i> and swept her gun-deck
from end to end. Terrible was the
slaughter done by that raking fire.</p>

<p>The next minute the bowsprit of the <i>Frolic</i>
caught in the rigging of the <i>Wasp</i>, and another
torrent of balls was poured into the
British ship. Then the Yankee sailors left
their guns and sprang for the enemy's deck.
The captain wanted them to keep firing, but he
could not hold them back.</p>

<p>First of them all was a brawny Jerseyman
named Jack Lang, who took his cutlass between
his teeth and clambered like a cat along the
bowsprit to the deck. Others followed, and
when they reached the deck of the <i>Frolic</i> they
found Jack Lang standing alone and looking
along the blood-stained deck with staring eyes.</p>

<p>Only four living men were to be seen, and
three of these were wounded. One was the
quartermaster at the wheel and the others were
officers. Not another man stood on his feet,
but the deck was strewn with the dead, whose
bodies rolled about at every heave of the waves.</p>

<p>When the men came running aft the three
officers flung down their swords to show that
they had surrendered, and one of them covered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
his face with his hands. It hurt him to give up
the good ship. Lieutenant Biddle, of the
<i>Wasp</i>, had to haul down the British flag.</p>

<p>Never had there been more terrible slaughter.
Of the 110 men on the <i>Frolic</i> there were
not twenty alive and unhurt, while on the <i>Wasp</i>
only five were dead and five wounded. The
hull of the <i>Frolic</i> was full of holes and its
masts were so cut away that in a few minutes
they both fell.</p>

<p>Thus ended one of the most famous of American
sea-fights. It was another lesson that
helped to stop the English from singing</p>

<div class='center'>
"Britannia rules the waves."<br />
</div>

<p>But the little <i>Wasp</i> and her gallant crew
did not get the good of their famous victory.
While they were busy repairing damages a sail
appeared above the far horizon. It came on,
growing larger and larger, and soon it was
seen to be a big man-of-war.</p>

<p>The game was up with the <i>Wasp</i> and her
prize, for the new ship was the <i>Poictiers</i>, a
great seventy-four ship-of-the-line. She snapped
up the <i>Wasp</i> and the <i>Frolic</i> and carried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
them off to the British isle of Bermuda, where
the victors found themselves prisoners.</p>

<p>A few words will finish the story of the
<i>Wasp</i>. She was taken into the British navy;
but she did not have to fight for her foes, for
she went down at sea without doing anything.
So she was saved from the disgrace of fighting
against her country.</p>

<p>Captain Jones and his men were soon exchanged,
and Congress voted them a reward
of $25,000 for their gallant fight, while the
brave captain was given the command of the
frigate <i>Macedonian</i>, which had been captured
from the British. It was Captain Stephen Decatur,
the hero of Tripoli, that captured her,
in the good ship <i>United States</i>.</p>

<p>Would you like to hear about the other
<i>Wasps</i>? There were two more of them, you
know. They were good ships, but ill luck came
to them all. The first <i>Wasp</i> did her work in
the Revolution, and had to be burned at Philadelphia
to keep her from the British when they
took that city. The second one, as I have just
told you, was lost at sea, and so was the third.
You may see that bad luck came to them all.</p>

<p>The third <i>Wasp</i> was, like the second, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
sloop-of-war, but she was a large and heavy
one. And though in the end she was lost at
sea and followed the other <i>Wasp</i> to the bottom,
she did not do so without sending some
British messengers there in advance.</p>

<p>I will tell you the story of this <i>Wasp</i>, and
how she used her sting, but it must be done in
few words.</p>

<p>She was built at Portsmouth, New Hampshire,
and sailed on May 1, 1814, her captain
being Johnston Blakeley; her crew a set of
young countrymen who were so unused to the
sea that most of them were seasick for a week.
Their average age was only twenty-three years,
so they were little more than boys. Yet the
most of them could hit a deer with a rifle, and
they soon showed they could hit a <i>Reindeer</i>
with a cannon. For near the end of June they
came across a British brig named the <i>Reindeer</i>,
and in less than twenty minutes had battered
her in so lively a fashion that her flag
came down and she was a prize.</p>

<p>The crew of the <i>Reindeer</i> were trained seamen,
but they did not know how to shoot. The
Americans were Yankee farmer-lads, yet they
shot like veteran gunners. I am sure you will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
think so when I tell you that the British could
hardly hit the <i>Wasp</i> at all, though she was less
than sixty yards away. But the Yankees hit
the <i>Reindeer</i> so often that she was cut to pieces
and her masts ready to fall. In fact, after she
was captured, she could not be taken into port,
but had to be set on fire and blown to pieces.</p>

<p>But I must say a good word for the gallant
captain of the <i>Reindeer</i>. First, a musket ball
hit him and went through the calves of both
legs, but he kept on his feet. Then a grape-shot&mdash;an
iron ball two inches thick&mdash;went
through both his thighs. The brave seaman
fell, but he rose to his feet again, drew his
sword, and called his men to board the <i>Wasp</i>.
He was trying to climb on board when a musket
ball went through his head. "O God!" he
cried, and fell dead.</p>

<p>This fight was in the English Channel,
where Blakeley was doing what John Paul
Jones had done years before. Two months
after the sinking of the <i>Reindeer</i> the <i>Wasp</i>
had another fight. This time there were three
British vessels, the <i>Avon</i>, the <i>Castilian</i>, and
the <i>Tartarus</i>, all of them brig-sloops like the
<i>Reindeer</i>. These vessels were scattered, chasing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
a privateer, and about nine o'clock at night
the <i>Wasp</i> came up with the <i>Avon</i> alone. They
hailed each other as ships do when they meet
at sea. Then, when sure they were enemies,
they began firing, as ships do also in time of
war. For forty minutes the fight kept up, and
then the <i>Avon</i> had enough. She was riddled
as the <i>Reindeer</i> had been. But the <i>Wasp</i> did
not take possession; for before a boat could be
sent on board, the two comrades of the <i>Avon</i>
came in sight.</p>

<p>The <i>Wasp</i>, after her battle with the <i>Avon</i>,
could not fight two more, so she sailed away
and left them to attend to their consort. They
could not save her. The <i>Wasp</i> had stung too
deeply for that. The water poured in faster
than the men of all three ships could pump
it out, and at one o'clock in the morning down
plunged the <i>Avon's</i> bow in the water, up went
her stern in the air, and with a mighty surge
she sank to rise no more. But the gallant
<i>Wasp</i> had ended her work. She took some
more prizes, but the sea, to whose depths she
had sent the <i>Reindeer</i> and <i>Avon</i>, took her also.
She was seen in October, and that was the
last that human eyes ever saw of her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>CAPTAIN LAWRENCE DIES FOR THE FLAG</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">His Words, "Do Not Give Up the Ship," Become the Famous Motto of the American Navy</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>THE United States navy had its <i>Hornet</i> as
well as its <i>Wasps</i>. And they were well
named, for they were all able to sting.
The captain of the <i>Hornet</i> was a noble seaman
named James Lawrence, who had been a midshipman
in the war with Tripoli. In the War
of 1812 he was captain in succession of the
<i>Vixen</i>, the <i>Wasp</i>, the <i>Argus</i>, and the <i>Hornet</i>.</div>

<p>The <i>Hornet</i> was a sloop-of-war. I have told
you what that means. She had three masts,
and carried square sails like a ship, but she
was called a sloop on account of her size. She
had eighteen short guns and two long ones.
The short guns threw thirty-two pound and
the long ones twelve pound balls.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course you have not forgotten the fight
of the <i>Constitution</i> with the <i>Java</i>. When the
<i>Constitution</i> went south to Brazil at that time
the <i>Hornet</i> went with her, but they soon parted.</p>

<p>In one of the harbors of Brazil Captain Lawrence
saw a British ship as big as the <i>Hornet</i>.
He waited outside for her, but she would not
come out. He had found a coward of a captain,
and he locked him up in that harbor for
two months.</p>

<p>Then he got tired and left. Soon after he
came across the <i>Peacock</i>, a British man-of-war
brig. The <i>Peacock</i> was as large as the <i>Hornet</i>
and its captain was as full of fight as Captain
Lawrence. He was the kind of man that our
bold Lawrence was hunting for. When two
men feel that way, a fight is usually not far off.
That was the way now. Soon the guns were
booming and the balls were flying.</p>

<p>But the fight was over before the men had
time to warm up. The first guns were fired at
5.25 in the afternoon, and at 5.39 the British
flag came down; so the battle lasted just fourteen
minutes. Not many victories have been
won so quickly as that.</p>

<p>But the <i>Hornet</i> acted in a very lively fashion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
while it lasted. Do you know how a hornet
behaves when a mischievous boy throws a stone
at its nest? Well, that is the way our <i>Hornet</i>
did. Only one ball from the <i>Peacock</i> struck
her, and hardly any of her men were hurt. But
the <i>Peacock</i> was bored as full of holes as a
pepper-box, and the water poured in faster
than all hands could pump it out. In a very
short time the unlucky <i>Peacock</i> filled and sank.
So Captain Lawrence had only the honor of
his victory; old ocean had swallowed up his
prize.</p>

<p>But if Captain Lawrence got no prize money,
he won great fame. He was looked on as another
Hull or Decatur, and Congress made him
captain of the frigate <i>Chesapeake</i>. That was
in one way a bad thing for the gallant Lawrence,
for it cost him his life. In another way
it was a good thing, for it made him one of the
most famous of American seamen.</p>

<p>I have told you the story of several victories
of American ships. I must now tell you the
story of one defeat. But I think you will say
it was a defeat as glorious as a victory. For
eight months the little navy of the young Republic
had sailed on seas where British ships<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
were nearly as thick as apples in an orchard.
In that time it had not lost a ship, and had won
more victories than England had done in
twenty years. Now it was to meet with its
first defeat.</p>

<p>When Captain Lawrence took command of
the <i>Chesapeake</i>, that ship lay in the harbor of
Boston. Outside this harbor was the British
frigate <i>Shannon</i>, blockading the port.</p>

<p>Now you must know that the American people
had grown very proud of their success on
the sea. They had got to think that any little
vessel could whip an English man-of-war. So
the Bostonians grew eager for the <i>Chesapeake</i>
to meet the <i>Shannon</i>. They were sure it would
be brought in as a prize, and they wanted to
hurrah over it.</p>

<p>Poor Lawrence was as eager as the people.
He was just the man they wanted. The
<i>Chesapeake</i> had no crew, but he set himself to
work, and in two weeks he filled her up with
such men as he could find.</p>

<p>It was a mixed team he got together, the
sweepings of the streets. There were some
good men among them, but more poor ones.
And they were all new men to the ship and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the captain. They had not been trained to
work together, and it was madness to fight a
first-class British ship with such a crew. Some,
in fact, were mutineers and gave him trouble
before he got out of the harbor.</p>

<p>But the <i>Shannon</i> was a crack ship with a
crack crew. Captain Broke had commanded
her for seven years and had a splendidly
trained set of men. He had copied from the
Americans and put sights on his guns, had
taught his men to fire at floating marks in the
sea, and had trained his topmen to use their
muskets in the same careful way. So when
Captain Lawrence sailed on June 1, 1813, he
sailed to defeat and death.</p>

<p>Captain Broke sent a challenge to the <i>Chesapeake</i>
to come out and fight him ship to ship.
But Lawrence did not wait for his challenge.
He was too eager for that, and set sail with a
crew who did not know their work, and most of
whom had never seen their officers before.</p>

<p>What could be expected of such mad courage
as that? It is one thing to be a brave man;
it is another to be a wise one. Of course you
will say that Captain Lawrence was brave; but
no one can say he was wise. Poor fellow, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
was simply throwing away his ship and his
life.</p>

<p>It was in the morning of June 1 that the
<i>Chesapeake</i> left the wharves of Boston. It
was 5.50 in the afternoon that she met the
<i>Shannon</i> and the battle began.</p>

<p>Both ships fired as fast as they could load,
but the men of the <i>Shannon</i> were much better
hands at their work, and their balls tore the
American ship in a terrible manner. A musket-ball
struck Lawrence in the leg, but he
would not go below. The rigging of the <i>Chesapeake</i>
was badly cut, the men at the wheel were
shot, and in ten minutes the two ships drifted
together.</p>

<p>Men on each side now rushed to board the
enemy's ship, and there was a hand-to-hand
fight at the bulwarks of the two ships. At this
moment Captain Lawrence was shot through
the body and fell with a mortal wound. He
was carried below.</p>

<p>As he lay in great pain he noticed that the
firing had almost ceased. Calling a surgeon's
mate to him, he said, "Tell the men to fire
faster, and not give up the ship; the colors
shall wave while I live."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, these words were spoken in
the moment of defeat. Captain Broke, followed
by a number of his men, had sprung to
the deck of the <i>Chesapeake</i>, and a desperate
struggle began. The Americans fought stubbornly,
but the fire from the trained men in the
<i>Shannon's</i> tops and the rush of British on
board soon gave Broke and his men the victory.
The daring Broke fell with a cut that
laid open his skull, but in a few moments the
Americans were driven below.</p>

<p>The <i>Chesapeake</i> was taken in just fifteen
minutes, one minute more than the <i>Hornet</i> had
taken to capture the <i>Peacock</i>.</p>

<p>The British hauled down the American flag,
and then hoisted it again with a white flag to
show their victory. But the sailor who did the
work, by mistake got the white flag under the
Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p>When the gunners in the <i>Shannon</i> saw the
Yankee flag flying they fired again, and this
time killed and wounded a number of their own
men, one of them being an officer.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i-198.jpg" width="600" height="349" alt="&quot;Don&#39;t Give up the Ship!&quot;" title="" />
<a href="images/i-198-big.jpg"><span class="caption">&quot;Don&#39;t Give up the Ship!&quot;</span></a>
</div>

<p>The gallant Lawrence never <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'know'">knew</ins> that his
ship was lost. He lived until the <i>Shannon</i>
reached Halifax with her prize, but he became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
delirious, and kept repeating over and over
again his last order&mdash;"<i>Don't give up the ship!</i>"</p>

<p>With these words he died. With these words
his memory has become immortal. "Don't give
up the ship!" is the motto of the American
navy, and will not be forgotten while our great
Republic survives. So Captain Lawrence
gained greater renown in defeat than most men
have won in victory.</p>

<p>The capture of the <i>Chesapeake</i> was a piece
of wonderful good fortune for the British, to
judge by the way they boasted of it. As Captain
Pearson had been made a knight for losing
the <i>Serapis</i>, so Captain Broke was made a
baronet for taking the <i>Chesapeake</i>. A "baronet,"
you must know, is a higher title than a
"knight," though they both use the handle of
"Sir" to their names.</p>

<p>The work of the <i>Shannon</i> proved&mdash;so the
British historians said&mdash;that, "if the odds were
anything like equal, a British frigate could
always whip an American, and in a hand-to-hand
conflict such would invariably be the
case."</p>

<p>Such things are easy to say, when one does
not care about telling the truth. Suppose we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
give now what a French historian, who believed
in telling the truth, said of this fight,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Captain Broke had commanded the <i>Shannon</i>
for nearly seven years; Captain Lawrence
had commanded the <i>Chesapeake</i> for but a few
days. The <i>Shannon</i> had cruised for eighteen
months on the coast of America; the <i>Chesapeake</i>
was newly out of harbor. The <i>Shannon</i>
had a crew long accustomed to habits of strict
obedience; the <i>Chesapeake</i> was manned by men
who had just been engaged in mutiny. The
Americans were wrong to accuse fortune on
this occasion. Fortune was not fickle, she was
merely logical."</p>

<p>That is about the same as to say that the
<i>Chesapeake</i> was given away to the enemy.
After that there were no more ships sent out of
port unfit to fight, merely to please the people.
It was a lesson the people needed.</p>

<p>The body of the brave Lawrence was laid on
the quarter-deck of the <i>Chesapeake</i> wrapped in
an American flag. It was then placed in a coffin
and taken ashore, where it was met by a regiment
of British troops and a band that played
the "Death March in Saul." The sword of
the dead hero lay on his coffin. In the end his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
body was buried in the cemetery of Trinity
Church, New York. A monument stands to-day
over his grave, and on it are the words:</p>

<p>"Neither the fury of battle, the anguish of
a mortal wound, nor the horrors of approaching
death could subdue his gallant spirit. His
dying words were</p>

<div class='center'>
'Don't give up the ship!'"<br />

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>COMMODORE PERRY WHIPS THE BRITISH ON LAKE ERIE</h3>

<h3>"<span class="smcap">We Have Met the Enemy and They Are Ours</span>"</h3>

<div class='cap'>IN the year 1813, when war was going on
between England and the United States,
the whole northern part of this country
was a vast forest. An ocean of trees stretched
away from the seaside in Maine for a thousand
miles to the west, and ended in the broad prairies
of the Mississippi region.</div>

<p>The chief inhabitants of this grand forest
were the moose and the deer, the wolf and the
panther, the wild turkey and the partridge, the
red Indian and the white hunter and trapper.
It was a very different country from what we
see to-day, for now its trees are replaced by
busy towns and fertile fields.</p>

<p>But in one way there has been no change.
North of the forest lands spread the Great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Lakes, the splendid inland seas of our northern
border; and these were then what they are now,
vast plains of water where all the ships of all
the nations might sail.</p>

<p>Along the shores of these mighty lakes
fighting was going on; at Detroit on the west;
at Niagara on the east. Soon war-vessels
began to be built and set afloat on the waters
of the lakes. And these vessels after a time
came together in fierce conflict. I have now to
tell the story of a famous battle between these
lake men-of-war. There was then in our navy
a young man named Oliver Hazard Perry. He
was full of the spirit of fight, but, while others
were winning victories on the high seas, he
was given nothing better to do than to command
a fleet of gunboats at Newport, Rhode
Island.</p>

<p>Perry became very tired of this. He wanted
to be where fighting was going on, and he kept
worrying the Navy Department for some active
work. So at last he was ordered to go to
the lakes, with the best men he had, and get
ready to fight the British there. Perry received
the order on February 17, 1813, and
before night he and fifty of his men were on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
their way west in sleighs; for the ground was
covered deep with snow.</p>

<p>The sleighing was good, but the roads were
bad and long; and it took him and his men two
weeks to reach Sackett's Harbor, at the north
end of Lake Ontario. From that place he went
to Presque Isle, on Lake Erie, where the fine
City of Erie now stands. Then only the seed
of a city was planted there, in a small village,
and the forest came down to the lake.</p>

<p>Captain Perry did not go to sleep when he
got to the water-side. He was not one of the
sleepy sort. He wanted vessels and he wanted
them quickly. The British had warships on
the lake, and Perry did not intend to let them
have it all to themselves.</p>

<p>When he got to Erie he found Captain Dobbins,
an old shipbuilder, hard at work. In the
woods around were splendid trees, white and
black oak and chestnut, for planking, and pine
for the decks. The axe was busy at these
giants of the forest; and so fast did the men
work, that a tree which was waving in the
forest when the sun rose might be cut down
and hewn into ship-timber before the sun set.
In that way Perry's fleet grew like magic out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of the forest. While the ships were building,
cannon and stores were brought from Pittsburgh
by way of the Allegheny River and its
branches. And Perry went to Niagara River,
where he helped capture a fine brig, called the
<i>Caledonia</i>, from the British.</p>

<p>Captain Dobbins built two more brigs, one
of which Perry named the <i>Niagara</i>. The other
he called <i>Lawrence</i>, after Captain Lawrence,
the story of whose life and death you have just
read.</p>

<p>Have any of you ever heard the story of the
man who built a wagon in his barn and then
found it too wide to go out through the door?
Perry was in the same trouble. His new ships
were too big to get out into the lake. There
was a bar at the mouth of the river with only
four feet of water on it. That was not deep
enough to float his new vessels. And he was
in a hurry to get these in deep water; for he
knew the British fleet would soon be down to
try to destroy them.</p>

<p>How would you work to get a six-foot vessel
over a four-foot sand bar? Well, that
doesn't matter; all we care for is the way Captain
Perry did it. He took two big scows and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
put one on each side of the <i>Lawrence</i>. Then
he filled them with water till the waves washed
over their decks. When they had sunk so far
they were tied fast to the brig and the water
was pumped out of them. As the water went
out they rose and lifted the <i>Lawrence</i> between
them until there were several feet of water
below her keel. Now the brig was hauled on
the bar until she touched the bottom; then she
was lifted again in the same way. This second
time took her out to deep water. Next, the
<i>Niagara</i> was lifted over the bar in the same
manner.</p>

<p>The next day the British, who had been
taking things very easily, came sailing down to
destroy Perry's ships. But they opened their
eyes wide when they saw them afloat on the
lake. They had lost their chance by wasting
their time.</p>

<p>Perry picked up men for his vessels wherever
he could get them. The most of those to
be had were landsmen. But he had his fifty
good men from Newport and a hundred were
sent him from the coast. Some of these had
been on the <i>Constitution</i> in her great fight with
the <i>Guerriere</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 384px;">
<img src="images/i-207.jpg" width="384" height="600" alt="Oliver H. Perry." title="" />
<span class="caption">Oliver H. Perry.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Early in August all was ready, and he set
sail. Early in September he was in Put-in Bay,
at the west end of Lake Erie, and here the
British came looking for him and his ships.</p>

<p>Perry was now the commodore of a fleet of
nine vessels,&mdash;the brigs <i>Lawrence</i>, <i>Niagara</i>
and <i>Caledonia</i>, five schooners, and one sloop.
Captain Barclay, the British commander, had
only six vessels, but some of them were larger
than Perry's. They were the ships <i>Detroit</i> and
<i>Queen Charlotte</i>, a large brig, two schooners,
and a sloop. Such were the fleets with which
the great battle of Lake Erie was fought.</p>

<p>I know you are getting tired of all this description,
and want to get on to the fighting.
You don't like to be kept sailing in quiet waters
when there is a fine storm ahead. Very well,
we will go on. But one has to get his bricks
ready before he can build his house.</p>

<p>Well, then, on the 10th of September, 1813,
it being a fine summer day, with the sun shining
brightly, Perry and his men sailed out
from Put-in Bay and came in sight of the British
fleet over the waters of the lake.</p>

<p>What Captain Perry now did was fine. He
hoisted a great blue flag, and when it unrolled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
in the wind the men saw on it, in white letters,
the dying words of Captain Lawrence, "Don't
give up the ship!" Was not that a grand signal
to give? It must have put great spirit into
the men, and made them feel that they would
die like the gallant Lawrence before they would
give up their ships. The men on both fleets
were eager to fight, but the wind kept very
light, and they came together slowly. It was
near noon before they got near enough for
their long guns to work. Then the British
began to send balls skipping over the water,
and soon after the Americans answered back.</p>

<p>Now came the roar of battle, the flash of
guns, the cloud of smoke that settled down and
half hid everything. The Americans came on
in a long line, head on for the British, who
awaited their approach. Perry's flagship, the
<i>Lawrence</i>, was near the head of the line. It
soon plunged into the very thick of the fight,
with only two little schooners to help it. The
wind may have been too light for the rest of
the fleet to come up. We do not know just
what kept them back, but at any rate, they
didn't come up, and the <i>Lawrence</i> was left to
fight alone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Never had a vessel been in a worse plight
than was the <i>Lawrence</i> for the next two hours.
She was half surrounded by the three large
British vessels, the <i>Detroit</i>, the <i>Queen Charlotte</i>,
and the brig <i>Hunter</i>, all pouring in their
fire at once, while she had to fight them all.
On the <i>Lawrence</i> and the two schooners
there were only seven long guns against thirty-six
which were pelting Perry's flagship from
the British fleet.</p>

<p>This was great odds. But overhead there
floated the words, "Don't give up the ship";
so the brave Perry pushed on till he was close
to the <i>Detroit</i>, and worked away, for life or
death, with all his guns, long and short.</p>

<p>Oh, what a dreadful time there was on Perry's
flagship during those sad two hours. The
great guns roared, the thick smoke rose, the
balls tore through her sides, sending splinters
flying like sharp arrows to right and left. Men
fell like leaves blown down by a gale. Blood
splashed on the living and flowed over the dead.
The surgeon's mates were kept busy carrying
the wounded below, where the surgeon dressed
their wounds.</p>

<p>Captain Perry's little brother, a boy of only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
thirteen years, was on the ship, and stood beside
him as brave as himself. Two bullets went
through the boy's hat; then a splinter cut
through his clothes; still he did not flinch.
Soon after, he was knocked down and the captain
grew pale with fear. But up jumped the
boy again. It was only a flying hammock that
had struck him. That little fellow was a true
sailor boy, and had in him plenty of Yankee
grit.</p>

<p>I would not, if I could, tell you all the horrors
of those two hours. It is not pleasant reading.
The cannon balls even came through the vessel's
sides among the wounded, and killed
some of them where they lay. At the end of
the fight the <i>Lawrence</i> was a mere wreck. Her
bowsprit and masts were nearly all cut away,
and out of more than a hundred men only fourteen
were unhurt. There was not a gun left
that could be worked.</p>

<p>Most men in such a case would have pulled
down their flag. But Oliver Perry had the
spirit of Paul Jones, and he did not forget the
words on his flag&mdash;"Don't give up the ship."</p>

<p>During those dread two hours the <i>Niagara</i>,
under Lieutenant Elliott, had kept out of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
fight. Now it came sailing up before a freshening
breeze.</p>

<p>As soon as Perry saw this fresh ship he
made up his mind what to do. He had a boat
lowered with four men in it. His little brother
leaped in after them. Then he stepped aboard
with the flag bearing Lawrence's motto on
his shoulder, and was rowed away to the
<i>Niagara</i>. As soon as the British saw this
little boat on the water, with Perry standing
upright, wrapped in the flag he had fought
for so bravely, they turned all their guns and
fired at it. Cannon and musket balls tore the
water round it. It looked as if nothing would
save those devoted men from death.</p>

<p>"Sit down!" cried Perry's men. "We will
stop rowing if you don't sit down."</p>

<p>So Perry sat down, and when a ball came
crashing through the side of the boat he took
off his coat and plugged up the hole.</p>

<p>Providence favored him and his men. They
reached the <i>Niagara</i> without being hurt. The
British had fired in vain. Perry sprang on
board and ordered the men to raise the flag.</p>

<p>"How goes the day?" asked Lieutenant
Elliott.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bad enough," said Perry. "Why are the
gunboats so far back?"</p>

<p>"I will bring them up," said Elliott.</p>

<p>"Do so," said Perry.</p>

<p>Elliott jumped into the boat which Perry
had just left, and rowed away. Up to the mast-head
went the great blue banner with the
motto, "Don't give up the ship." Signals were
given for all the vessels to close in on the
enemy, and the <i>Niagara</i> bore down under full
sail.</p>

<p>The <i>Lawrence</i> was out of the fight. Rent
and torn, with only a handful of her crew on
their feet, and not a gun that could be fired,
her day was done. Her flag was pulled down
by the few men left to save themselves. The
British had no time to take possession, for the
<i>Niagara</i> was on them, fresh for the fray, like a
new horse in the race.</p>

<p>Right through the British fleet this new ship
went. Three of their ships were on one side of
her and two on the other, and all only a few
yards away. As she went her guns spoke out,
sweeping their decks and tearing through their
timbers.</p>

<p>The <i>Lawrence</i> had already done her share<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of work on these vessels, and this new pounding
was more than they could stand. The
other American vessels also were pouring their
shot into the foe. Flesh and blood could not
bear this. Men were falling like grass before
the scythe. A man sprang up on the rail of
the <i>Detroit</i> and waved a white flag to show
that they had surrendered. The great fight
was over. The British had given up.</p>

<p>Perry announced his victory in words that
have become historic: "We have met the
enemy and they are ours."</p>

<p>This famous despatch was written with a
pencil on the back of an old letter, with his hat
for a table. It was sent to General Harrison,
who commanded an army nearby. Harrison
at once led his cheering soldiers against the
enemy, and gave them one of the worst defeats
of the war.</p>

<p>When the news of the victory spread over
the country the people were wild with joy.
Congress thanked Perry and voted gold medals
to him and Elliott, and honors or rewards to
all the officers and men. But over the whole
country it was thought that Elliott had earned
disgrace instead of a gold medal by keeping so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
long out of the fight. He said he had only
obeyed orders, but people thought that was a
time to break orders.</p>

<p>Perry was made a full captain by Congress.
This was then the highest rank in the navy.
But he took no more part in the war. Six
years later he was sent with a squadron to
South America, and there he took the yellow
fever and died. Thus passed away one of the
most brilliant and most famous officers of the
American navy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>COMMODORE PORTER GAINS GLORY IN THE PACIFIC</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Gallant Fight of the "Essex" Against Great Odds</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>ANY of you who have read much of American
history must have often met with
the names of Porter and Farragut.
There are no greater names in our naval history.
There was Captain David Porter and
his two gallant sons, all men of fame. And the
still more famous Admiral Farragut began his
career under the brave old captain of the War
of 1812.</div>

<p>I am going now to tell you about David
Porter and the little <i>Essex</i>, a ship whose name
the British did not like to hear. And I have
spoken of Farragut from the fact that he began
his naval career under Captain Porter.</p>

<p>Captain Porter was born in 1780, before the
Revolution had ended. His father was a sea-captain;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and when the boy was sixteen years
old, he stood by his father's side on the schooner
<i>Eliza</i> and helped to fight off a British press-gang
which wanted to rob it of some of its
sailors. The press-gang was a company of
men who seized men wherever they found them,
and dragged them into the British navy, where
they were compelled to serve as sailors or marines.
It was a cruel and unjust way of getting men,
and the Americans resisted it wherever
they could. In this particular fight several
men were killed and wounded, and the press-gang
thought it best to let the <i>Eliza</i> alone.</p>

<p>When the lad was seventeen he was twice
seized by press-men and taken to serve in the
British navy, but both times he escaped. Then
he joined the American navy as a midshipman.</p>

<p>Young Porter soon showed what was in him.
In the naval war with France he was put on a
French prize that was full of prisoners who
wanted to seize the ship. For three days Porter
helped to watch them, and in all that time
he did not take a minute's sleep.</p>

<p>Afterward, in a pilot-boat, with fifteen men
the boy hero attacked a French privateer with
forty men and a barge with thirty men. Porter,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
with his brave fifteen, boarded the privateer
and fought like a hero. After more than half
its crew were killed and wounded the privateer
surrendered. In this hard fight not one of
Porter's men was hurt.</p>

<p>That was only one of the things which young
Porter did. When the war with the pirates of
Tripoli began, he was there, and again did
some daring deeds. He was on the <i>Philadelphia</i>
when that good ship ran aground and was
taken by the Moors, and he was held a prisoner
till the end of the war. Here you have an outline
of the early history of David Porter.</p>

<p>When the War of 1812 broke out, he was
made captain of the <i>Essex</i>. The <i>Essex</i> was a
little frigate that had been built in the Revolution.
It was not fit to fight with the larger
British frigates, but with David Porter on its
quarter-deck it was sure to make its mark.</p>

<p>On the <i>Essex</i> with him was a fine little midshipman,
only eleven years old, who had been
brought up in the Porter family. His name
was David G. Farragut. I shall have a good
story of him to tell you later on, for he grew
up to be one of the bravest and greatest men
in the American navy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>On July 2, 1812, only two weeks after war
was declared, Porter was off to sea in the
<i>Essex</i>, on the hunt for prizes and glory. He
got some prizes, but it was more than a month
before he had a chance for glory. Then he
came in sight of a British man-of-war, a sight
that pleased him very much.</p>

<p>Up came the <i>Essex</i>, pretending to be a merchant
ship and with the British flag flying.
That is one of the tricks which naval officers
play. They think it right to cheat an enemy.
The stranger came bowling down under full
sail and fired a gun as a hint for the supposed
merchantman to stop. So the <i>Essex</i> backed
her sails and hove to until the stranger had
passed her stern.</p>

<p>Porter was now where he had wanted to get.
He had the advantage of the wind&mdash;what
sailors call the "weather-gage." So down
came the British flag and up went the Stars
and Stripes: and the ports were thrown open,
showing the iron mouths of the guns, ready to
bark.</p>

<p>When the English sailors saw this they
cheered loudly and ran to their guns. They
fired in their usual hasty fashion, making much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
noise but doing no harm. Porter waited till
he was ready to do good work, and then fired
a broadside that fairly staggered the British
ship.</p>

<p>The Englishman had not bargained for such
a salute as this, and now tried to run away.
But the <i>Essex</i> had the wind, and in eight minutes
was alongside. And in those eight minutes
her guns were busy as guns could be.
Then down came the British flag. That was
the shortest fight in the war.</p>

<p>The prize was found to be the corvette <i>Alert</i>.
A corvette is a little ship with not many guns.
She was not nearly strong enough for the
<i>Essex</i>, and gave up when only three of her
men were wounded. But she had been shot so
full of holes that she already had seven feet of
water in her hold and was in danger of sinking.
It kept the men of the <i>Essex</i> busy enough
to pump her out and stop up the holes, so that
she should not go to the bottom. Captain
Porter did not want to lose his prize. He came
near losing it, and his ship too, in another way,
as I have soon to tell.</p>

<p>You must remember that he had taken other
prizes and sent them home with some of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
men. So he had a large number of prisoners,
some of them soldiers taken from one of his
prizes. There were many more British on
board than there were Americans, and some of
them formed a plot to capture the ship. They
might have done it, too, but for the little midshipman,
David Farragut.</p>

<p>This little chap was lying in his hammock,
when he saw an Englishman come along with
a pistol in his hand. This was the leader in
the plot who was looking around to see if all
was ready for his men to break out on the
Americans.</p>

<p>He came up to the hammock where the boy
lay and looked in at him. The bright young
fellow then had his eyes tight shut and seemed
to be fast asleep. After looking a minute the
man went away. The instant he was out of
sight up jumped the lad and ran to the captain's
cabin. You may be sure he did not take many
words to tell what he had seen.</p>

<p>Captain Porter knew there was no time to
be lost. He sprang out of bed in haste and ran
to the deck. Here he gave a loud yell of "Fire!
Fire!"</p>

<p>In a minute the men came tumbling up from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
below like so many rats. They had been
trained what to do in case of a night-fire and
every man ran to his place. Captain Porter
had even built fires that sent up volumes of
smoke, so as to make them quick to act and to
steady their nerves.</p>

<p>While the cry of fire roused the Americans,
it scared the conspirators, and before they
could get back their wits the sailors were on
them. It did not take long to lock them up
again. In that way Porter and Farragut saved
their ship.</p>

<p>The time was coming in which he would
lose his ship, but the way he lost it brought him
new fame. I must tell you how this came
about. When the <i>Constitution</i> and the <i>Hornet</i>,
as I have told you in another story, were in
the waters of Brazil, the <i>Essex</i> was sent to
join them. You know what was done there,
how the <i>Constitution</i> whipped and sunk the
<i>Java</i>, and the <i>Hornet</i> did the same for the
<i>Peacock</i>.</p>

<p>There was no such luck for the <i>Essex</i>, and
after his fellow-ships had gone north Captain
Porter went cruising on his own account. In
the Pacific Ocean were dozens of British whalers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and other ships. Here was a fine field for
prizes. So he set sail, went round the stormy
Cape Horn in a hurricane, and was soon in the
great ocean of the west.</p>

<p>I shall not tell you the whole story of this
cruise. The <i>Essex</i> here was like a hawk
among a flock of partridges. She took prize
after prize, until she had about a dozen valuable
ships.</p>

<p>When the news of what Porter was doing
reached England, there was a sort of panic.
Something must be done with this fellow or
he would clear the Pacific of British trade. So
a number of frigates were sent in the hunt for
him. They were to get him in any way they
could.</p>

<p>After a long cruise on the broad Pacific, the
<i>Essex</i> reached the port of Valparaiso, on the
coast of Chile, in South America. She had
with her one of her prizes, the <i>Essex Junior</i>.
Here Porter heard that a British frigate, the
<i>Phoebe</i>, was looking for him. That pleased
him. He wanted to come across a British war-vessel,
so he concluded to wait for her. He
was anxious for something more lively than
chasing whaling ships.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>He was not there long before the <i>Phoebe</i>
came, and with her a small warship, the
<i>Cherub</i>.</p>

<p>When the <i>Phoebe</i> came in sight of the <i>Essex</i>
it sailed close up. Its captain had been told
that half the American crew were ashore, and
very likely full of Spanish wine. But when he
got near he saw the Yankee sailors at their
guns and ready to fight. When he saw this he
changed his mind. He jumped on a gun and
said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Captain Hillyar's compliments to Captain
Porter, and hopes he is well."</p>

<p>"Very well, I thank you," said Porter. "But
I hope you will not come too near for fear some
accident might take place which would be disagreeable
to you."</p>

<p>"I had no intention of coming on board,"
said Captain Hillyar, when he saw the look of
things on the deck of the <i>Essex</i>. "I am sorry
I came so near you."</p>

<p>"Well, you have no business where you are,"
said Porter. "If you touch a rope yarn of this
ship, I shall board instantly."</p>

<p>With that the <i>Phoebe</i> wore round and went
off. It was a neutral port and there was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
good excuse for not fighting, but it was well
for Porter that he was ready.</p>

<p>A few days later he heard that some other
British ships were coming from Valparaiso and
he concluded to put to sea. He didn't want to
fight a whole fleet. But the wind treated him
badly. As he sailed out a squall struck the
<i>Essex</i> and knocked her maintopmast into the
sea. Porter now ran into a small bay near at
hand and dropped anchor close to the shore.</p>

<p>Here was the chance for the <i>Phoebe</i> and the
<i>Cherub</i>. They could stand off and hammer the
<i>Essex</i> where she could not fire back. They
had over thirty long guns while the <i>Essex</i> had
only six, and only three of these could be used.
The rest of her guns were short ones that
would not send a ball far enough to reach the
British ships.</p>

<p>The <i>Essex</i> was in a trap. The British began
to pour solid iron into her at the rate of nearly
ten pounds to her one. For two hours this
was kept up. There was frightful slaughter
on the <i>Essex</i>. Her men were falling like dead
leaves, but Porter would not yield.</p>

<p>After this went on for some time there came
a change in the wind, and the <i>Essex</i> spread<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
what sail she had and tried to get nearer. But
the <i>Phoebe</i> would not wait for her, but sailed
away and kept pumping balls into her.</p>

<p>Soon the wind changed again. Now all
hope was gone. The American crew was being
murdered and could not get near the British.
Porter tried to run his ship ashore, intending
to fight to the last and then blow her up.</p>

<p>But the treacherous wind shifted again and
he could not even reach the shore. Dead and
wounded men lay everywhere. Flames were
rising in the hold. Water was pouring into
shot holes. The good ship had fought her last
and it was madness to go on. So at 6.20
o'clock, two and a half hours after the fight
began, her flag came down and the battle was
over.</p>

<p>The story of the cruise of the <i>Essex</i> and her
great struggle against odds was written for
us by her young midshipman&mdash;David Farragut.
President Roosevelt, in his Naval History
of the War of 1812, says the following
true words about Captain Porter's brave fight:</p>

<p>"As an exhibition of dogged courage it has
never been surpassed since the time when the
Dutch Captain Keasoon, after fighting two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
long days, blew up his disabled ship, devoting
himself and all his crew to death, rather than
surrender to the hereditary foes of his race."
Porter was the man to do the same thing, but
he felt he had no right to send all his men to
death.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">COMMODORE MacDONOUGH'S VICTORY ON LAKE CHAMPLAIN</span></h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">How General Prevost and the British Ran Away</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>THE United States is a country rich in
lakes. They might be named by the
thousands. But out of this host of lakes
very few are known in history, and of them all
much the most famous is Lake Champlain.</div>

<p>Do you wish to know why? Well, because
this lake forms a natural waterway from
Canada down into the States. If you look on
a map you will see that Lake Champlain and
Lake George stretch down nearly to the Hudson
River and that their waters flow north into
the great St. Lawrence River. So these lakes
make the easiest way to send trade, and troops
as well, down from Canada into New York and
New England.</p>

<p>Now just let us take a look back in history.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
The very first battle in the north of our country
was fought on Lake Champlain. This was
in 1609, when Samuel de Champlain and his
Indian friends came down this lake in canoes
to fight with the Iroquois tribes of New
York.</p>

<p>Then in 1756 the French and Indians did
the same thing. They came in a fleet of boats
and canoes and fought the English on Lake
George. Twenty years afterward there was
the fierce fight which General Arnold made on
this lake, of which I have told you. Later on
General Burgoyne came down Lakes Champlain
and George with a great army. He never
went back again, for he and his army were
taken prisoners by the brave Colonials. But
the last and greatest of all the battles on the
lakes was that of 1814. It is of this I am now
about to tell you.</p>

<p>You should know that the British again tried
what they had done when they sent Burgoyne
down the lakes. This time it was Sir George
Prevost who was sent, with an army of more
than 11,000 men, to conquer New York. He
didn't do it any more than Burgoyne did, for
Lieutenant Thomas MacDonough was in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
way. I am going to tell you how the gallant
MacDonough stopped him.</p>

<p>MacDonough was a young man, as Perry
was. He had served, as a boy, in the war with
Tripoli. In 1806, when he was only twenty
years old, he gave a Yankee lesson to a British
captain who wanted to carry off an American
sailor.</p>

<p>This was at Gibraltar, where British guns
were as thick as blackbirds; but the young lieutenant
took the man out of the English boat
and then dared the captain to try to take him
back again. The captain blustered; but he did
not try, in spite of all his guns.</p>

<p>In 1813 MacDonough was sent to take care
of affairs on Lake Champlain. No better man
could have been sent. He did what Perry had
done; he set himself to build ships and get
guns and powder and shot and prepare for
war. The British were building ships, too, for
they wanted to be masters of the lake before
they sent their army down. So the sounds of
the axe and saw and hammer came before the
sound of cannon on the lake.</p>

<p>MacDonough did not let the grass grow
under his feet. When he heard that the British<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
were building a big frigate, he set to work
to build a brig. The keel was laid on July
29, and she was launched on August 16&mdash;only
eighteen days! There must have been
some lively jumping about in the wildwoods
shipyard just then.</p>

<p>The young commander had no time to waste,
for the British were coming. The great war
in Europe with Napoleon was over and England
had plenty of ships and men to spare.
A flock of her white-winged frigates came
sailing over the ocean and swarmed like bees
along our coast. And an army of the men
who had fought against Napoleon was sent to
Canada to invade New York. It was thought
the Yankees could not stand long before veterans
like these.</p>

<p>Down marched the British army and down
sailed the British fleet. But MacDonough was
not caught napping. He was ready for the
British ships when they came.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<a href="images/i-234-big.jpg"><span class="caption">Battle of Lake Champlain&mdash;<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'McDonough&#39;s'">MacDonough&#39;s</ins> Victory.</span></a>
</div>

<p>And now, before the battle begins, let us
give a few names and figures; for these are
things you must know. The Americans had
four vessels and ten gunboats. The vessels
were the ship <i>Saratoga</i>, the brig <i>Eagle</i>, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
schooner <i>Ticonderoga</i>, and the sloop <i>Preble</i>.
The British had the frigate <i>Confiance</i>, larger
than any of the American ships, the brig <i>Linnet</i>,
the sloops <i>Chubb</i> and <i>Finch</i>, and thirteen
gunboats. And the British were better off for
guns and men, though the difference was not
great. Such were the two fleets that came together
on a bright Sunday on September 11,
1814, to see which should be master of Lake
Champlain.</p>

<p>The American ships were drawn up across
Plattsburg Bay, and up this bay came the British
fleet to attack them, just as Carleton's vessels
had come up to attack Arnold forty years
before.</p>

<p>At Plattsburg was the British army, and
opposite, across Saranac River, lay a much
smaller force of American regulars and militia.
They could easily see the ships, but they were
too busy for that, for the soldiers were fighting
on land while the sailors were fighting on
water. Bad work that for a sunny September
Sunday, wasn't it?</p>

<p>MacDonough had stretched his ships in a
line across the bay, and had anchors down at
bow and stern, with ropes tied to the anchor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
chains so that the ships could be swung round
easily. Remember that, for that won him the
battle.</p>

<p>It was still early in the day when the British
came sailing up, firing as soon as they came
near enough. These first shots did no harm,
but they did a comical thing. One of them
struck a hen-coop on the <i>Saratoga</i>, in which
one of the sailors kept a fighting cock. The
coop was knocked to pieces, and into the rigging
flew the brave cock, flapping his wings
at the British vessels and crowing defiance to
them, while the sailors laughed and cheered.</p>

<p>But the battle did not fairly begin until the
great frigate <i>Confiance</i> came up and dropped
anchor a few hundred yards from the <i>Saratoga</i>.
Then she blazed away with all the guns
on that side of her deck.</p>

<p>This was a terrible broadside, the worst any
American ship had felt in the whole war.
Every shot hit the <i>Saratoga</i> and tore through
her timbers, sending splinters flying like hail.
So frightful was the shock that nearly half
the crew were thrown to the deck. About forty
of them did not get up again; they were either
killed or wounded. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Afew'">A few</ins>  broadsides like that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
would have ended the fight, for it would have
left the <i>Saratoga</i> without men.</p>

<p>On both sides now the cannon roared and
the shots flew, but the British guns were the
best and the Americans had the worst of it.
The commodore was knocked down twice. The
last time he was hit with the head of a man
that had been shot off and came whirling
through the air.</p>

<p>"The commodore is killed!" cried the men;
but in a trice he was up again, and aiming and
firing one of his own guns.</p>

<p>This dreadful work went on for two hours.
All that time the two biggest British vessels
were pelting the <i>Saratoga</i>, and the other
American ships were not helping her much.
Red-hot <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'shot'">shots</ins>  were fired, which set her on fire
more than once.</p>

<p>At the end MacDonough had not a single
gun left to fire back. It looked as if all was up
with the Americans, all of whose ships were
being battered by the enemy. But Commodore
MacDonough was not yet at the end of his
plans. He now cut loose his stern anchor and
bade his men pull on the rope that led to the
bow anchor. In a minute the ship began to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
swing round. Soon she had a new side turned
to the foe. Not a gun had been fired on this
side. When the British captain saw what the
Americans were doing he tried the same thing.
But it did not work as well with him. The
<i>Confiance</i> began to swing round, but when
she got her stern turned to the Americans she
stuck fast. Pull and haul as they might, the
sailors could not move her another inch.</p>

<p>Here was a splendid chance for the men on
the <i>Saratoga</i>. They poured their broadsides
into the stern of the <i>Confiance</i> and raked her
from end to end, while her position was a helpless
one. The men fled from the guns. The
ship was being torn into splinters. No hope
for her was left. She could not fire a gun.
Her captain was dead, but her lieutenant saw
that all was over, and down came her flag.</p>

<p>Then the <i>Saratoga</i> turned on the brig <i>Linnet</i>
and served her in the same fashion.</p>

<p>That ended the battle. The two sloops had
surrendered before, the gunboats were driven
away by the <i>Ticonderoga</i>, and the hard fight
was done. Once more the Americans were
victors. Perry had won one lake. MacDonough
had won another.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>And that was not the whole of it. For as
soon as the American soldiers saw the British
flag down and the Stars and Stripes still afloat,
they set up a shout that rang back from the
Vermont hills.</p>

<p>Sir George Prevost, though he had an army
of veterans twice as strong as the American
army of militia, broke camp and sneaked away
under cover of a storm.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3>FOUR NAVAL HEROES IN ONE CHAPTER</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Fights With the Pirates of the Gulf and the Corsairs of the Mediterranean</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>WE have so far been reading the story of
legal warfare; now let us turn to that
of the wild warfare of the pirate ships.
Pirates swarmed during and after the War of
1812, and the United States had its hands full
in dealing with them. They haunted the Gulf
of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, and they
went back to their old bad work in the Mediterranean.
They kept our naval leaders busy
enough for a number of years.</div>

<p>The first we shall speak of are the Lafittes,
the famous sea-rovers of the Gulf of Mexico.
Those men had their hiding places in the lowlands
of Louisiana, where there are reedy
streams and grassy islands by the hundreds,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
winding in and out in a regular network.
From these lurking places the pirate ships
would dash out to capture vessels and then
hurry back to their haunts.</p>

<p>The Lafittes (Jean and Pierre) had a whole
fleet of pirate ships, and were so daring that
they walked the streets of New Orleans as if
that city belonged to them, and boldly sold their
stolen goods in its marts, and nobody meddled
with them.</p>

<p>But the time came when they were attacked
in their haunts and the whole gang was broken
up. This was near the end of the war, when
the government had some ships to spare. After
that they helped General Jackson in the celebrated
battle of New Orleans, and fought so
well that they were forgiven and were thanked
for their services.</p>

<p>When the War of 1812 was over many of
the privateers became pirates. A privateer,
you know, is something like a pirate. He robs
one nation, while a pirate robs all. So hundreds
of those men became sea-robbers.</p>

<p>After 1814 the seas of the West Indies were
full of pirates. There was no end of hiding
places among the thousand islands of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
seas, where the pirates could bring their prizes
and enjoy their wild revels. The warm airs,
the ripe fruits and wild game of those shores
made life easy and pleasant, and prizes were
plentiful on the seas.</p>

<p>When the war ended the United States
gained a fine trade with the West Indies. But
many of the ships that sailed there did not come
home again, though there were no hurricanes
to sink them. And some that did come home
had been chased by ships that spread the
rovers' black flag. So it was plain enough that
pirates were at work.</p>

<p>For years they had it their own way, with
no one to trouble them. The government for
years let them alone. But in time they grew
so daring that in 1819 a squadron of warships
was sent after them, under Commodore Perry,
the hero of Lake Erie. Poor Perry caught
the yellow fever and died, and his ships came
home without doing anything.</p>

<p>After that the pirates were let alone for two
years. Now-a-days they would not have been
let alone for two weeks, but things went more
slowly then. No doubt the merchants who sent
cargoes to sea complained of the dreadful doings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
of the pirates, but the government did not
trouble itself much, and the sea-robbers had
their own way until 1821.</p>

<p>By that time it was felt that something must
be done, and a small fleet of pirate hunters was
sent to the West Indies. It included the famous
sloop-of-war <i>Hornet</i>, the one which had
fought the <i>Peacock</i>, and the brig <i>Enterprise</i>,
which Decatur had been captain of in the
Moorish war.</p>

<p>The pirates were brave enough when they
had only merchant ships to deal with, but they
acted like cowards when they found warships
on their track. They fled in all directions, and
many of their ships and barges were taken.
After that they kept quiet for a time, but soon
they were at their old work again.</p>

<p>In 1823 Captain David Porter, he who had
fought so well in the <i>Essex</i>, was sent against
them. The brave young Farragut was with
him. He brought a number of barges and
small vessels, so that he could follow the sea-robbers
into their hiding places.</p>

<p>One of these places was found at Cape Cruz,
on Porto Rico. Here the pirate captain and
his men fought like tigers, and the captain's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
wife stood by his side and fought as fiercely as
he did. After the fight was over the sailors
found a number of caves used by the pirates.
In some of them were great bales of goods, and
in others heaps of human bones. All this told
a dreadful story of robbery and murder.</p>

<p>Another fight took place at a haunt of pirates
on the coast of Cuba, where Lieutenant Allen,
a navy officer, had been killed the year before
in an attack on the sea-robbers.</p>

<p>Here there were over seventy pirates and
only thirty-one Americans. But the sailors
cried "Remember Allen!" and dashed so
fiercely at the pirate vessels, that the cowardly
crews jumped overboard and tried to swim
ashore. But the hot-blooded sailors rowed in
among them and cut fiercely with their cutlasses,
so that hardly any of them escaped.
Their leader, who was named Diabolito, or
"Little Devil," was one of the killed.</p>

<p>In this way the pirate hordes were broken
up, after they had robbed and murdered among
the beautiful West India islands for many
years. After that defeat they gave no more
trouble. Among the pirates was Jean Lafitte,
one of the Lafitte brothers, of whose doings you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
have read above. After the battle of New
Orleans he went to Texas, and in time became
a pirate captain again. As late as 1822 his
name was the terror of the Gulf. Then he
disappeared and no one knew what had become
of him. He may have died in battle or have
gone down in storm.</p>

<p>But the pirates of the West Indies and the
Gulf were not the only ones the United States
had to deal with. You have read the story of
the Moorish corsairs and of the fighting at
Tripoli. Now I have something more to tell
about them; for when they heard that the
United States was at war with England, they
tried their old tricks again, capturing American
sailors and selling them for slaves.</p>

<p>They had their own way until the war was
over. Then two squadrons of war vessels were
sent to the Mediterranean, one under Commodore
Bainbridge, who had commanded the <i>Constitution</i>
when she fought the <i>Java</i>, and the
other under Commodore Decatur, the gallant
sailor who had burned the <i>Philadelphia</i> in the
harbor of Tripoli.</p>

<p>Decatur got there first, and it did not take
him long to bring the Moors to their senses.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
The trouble this time was with Algiers, not
with Tripoli. Algiers was one of the strongest
of the Moorish states.</p>

<p>On the 15th of June, 1815, Decatur came in
sight of the most powerful of the Algerine
ships, a forty-six gun frigate, the <i>Mashouda</i>.
Its commander was Rais Hammida, a fierce
and daring fellow, who was called "the terror
of the Mediterranean." He had risen from the
lowest to the highest place in the navy, and had
often shown his valor in battle. But his time
for defeat had now come.</p>

<p>When the Moorish admiral found himself
amid a whole squadron of American warships,
he set sail with all speed and made a wild dash
for Algiers. But he had faster ships in his
track and was soon headed off.</p>

<p>The bold fellow had no chance at all, with
half-a-dozen great ships around him, but he
made a fine fight for his life. He did not save
either his ship or his life, for a cannon ball cut
him squarely in two; and when his lieutenant
tried to run away, he came across the brig
<i>Epervier</i>, which soon settled him. But the
<i>Mashouda</i> had made a good fight against big
odds, and deserved praise.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>After that another Algerian ship was taken,
and then Decatur sailed for Algiers. When
he made signals the captain of the port came
out. A black-bearded, high and mighty fellow
he was.</p>

<p>"Where is your navy?" asked Decatur.</p>

<p>"It's all right," said the Algerian, "safe in
some friendly port."</p>

<p>"Not all of it, I fancy," said Decatur. "I
have your frigate <i>Mashouda</i> and your brig <i>Estido</i>,
and your admiral Hammida is killed."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," said the Algerian.</p>

<p>"I can easily prove it," said Decatur, and he
sent for the first lieutenant of the <i>Mashouda</i>.</p>

<p>When the captain of the port saw him and
heard his story, he changed his tone. His
haughty manner passed away, and he begged
that fighting should cease until a treaty could
be made on shore.</p>

<p>"Fighting will not cease until I have the
treaty," said Decatur, sternly; "and a treaty
will not be made anywhere but on board my
ship."</p>

<p>And so it was. The captain of the port came
out next day with authority to make a treaty.
But the captain did not want to return the property<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
taken from the American ships, saying
that it had been scattered among many hands.</p>

<p>"I can't help that. It must be returned or
paid for," said Decatur.</p>

<p>Then the captain did not want to pay $10,000
for a vessel that had been captured, and he
wanted tribute from the United States. He
told Decatur what a great man his master,
"Omar the Terrible," was, and asked for a
three hours truce.</p>

<p>"Not a minute," said Decatur. "If your
ships appear before the treaty is signed by the
Dey, and the American prisoners are on board
my ship, I shall capture every one of them."</p>

<p>The only concession Decatur would make
was to promise to return the <i>Mashouda</i>. But
this was to be taken as a gift from the Americans
to the Dey, and as such it must not appear
in the treaty. The Algerian, finding that
all his eloquence was wasted on the unyielding
Yankee, hurried ashore with the treaty, arranging
to display a white flag in case of its
being signed.</p>

<p>An hour after he left an Algerian man-of-war
was seen out to sea, and the American vessels
got ready for action. But before anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
was done the captain of the port came out with
a white flag. He brought the treaty and the
prisoners. That ended the trouble with Algiers.
When the ten freed captives reached
the deck some knelt down and gave thanks to
God, while others hastened to kiss the American
flag.</p>

<p>Then Decatur sailed to Tunis and Tripoli
and made their rulers come to terms. From
that day to this no American ship has been
troubled by the corsairs of Barbary.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>COMMODORE PERRY OPENS JAPAN TO THE WORLD</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">An Heroic Deed Without Bloodshed</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>THERE are victories of peace as well as of
war. Of course, you do not need to be
told that. Everybody knows it. And
it often takes as much courage to win these
victories as it does those of war. I am going
now to tell you of one of the greatest victories
ever won by an American naval hero, and without
firing a gun.</div>

<p>Not far away from the great empire of China
lies the island empire of Japan. Here the map
shows us three or four large islands, but there
are many hundreds of small ones, and in and
out among them flow the smiling blue waters
of the great Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>The people of Japan, like the people of China,
for a long time did not like foreigners and did
not want anything to do with them. But that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
was the fault of the foreigners themselves. For
at first these people were glad to have strangers
come among them, and treated them kindly,
and let missionaries land and try to make
Christians of them. But the Christian teachers
were not wise; for they interfered with the
government as well as with the faith of the
people.</p>

<p>The Japanese soon grew angry at this. In
the end they drove all the strangers away and
killed all the Christian converts they could find.
Then laws were made to keep all foreigners out
of the country. They let a Dutch ship come
once a year to bring some foreign goods to the
seaport of Nagasaki, but they treated these
Dutch traders as if they were of no account.
And thus it continued in Japan for nearly three
hundred years.</p>

<p>The Japanese did not care much for the
Dutch goods, but they liked to hear, now and
then, what was going on in the world. Once a
year they let some of the Dutch visit the capital,
but these had to crawl up to the emperor
on their hands and knees and crawl out backward
like crabs. They must have wanted the
Japanese trade badly to do that.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>When a vessel happened to be wrecked on
the coast of Japan, the sailors were held as
prisoners and there was much trouble to get
them off; and when Japanese were wrecked and
sent home, no thanks were given. They were
looked upon as no longer Japanese.</p>

<p>The Russians had seaports in Siberia, which
made them near neighbors to Japan, so they
tried to make friends with the Japanese. But
the island people would have nothing to do
with them. Captain Golownin, of the Russian
navy, landed on one of the islands; but he was
taken prisoner and kept for a long time and
treated cruelly. That was the way things went
in Japan till 1850 had come and passed.</p>

<p>It took the Yankees to do what the Dutch
and the Russians had failed in doing. After
the war with Mexico, thousands of Americans
went to California and other parts of the Pacific
coast, and trading ships grew numerous on
that great ocean. It was felt to be time that
Japan should be made to open her ports to the
commerce of the nations, and the United States
tried to do it.</p>

<p>Captain Matthew Calbraith Perry was selected
for this great work. Captain Perry was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
a brother of Oliver H. Perry, the hero of Lake
Erie. He was a lieutenant in that war, but he
commanded a ship in the war with the pirates
and the Mexican war. In 1852 he was given
the command of a commodore and sent out with
a fine squadron to Japan. He took with him a
letter from the President to the Tycoon, or
military ruler, of Japan.</p>

<p>On the 8th of July, 1853, the eyes of many
of the Japanese opened wide when they saw
four fine vessels sailing grandly up the broad
Bay of Yeddo, where such a sight had never
been seen before. As late as 1850 the ruler of
Japan had sent word to foreign nations that
he would have nothing to do with them or their
people, and now here came these daring ships.</p>

<p>These ships were the steam frigates <i>Mississippi</i>
and <i>Susquehanna</i>, and the sailing ships
<i>Saratoga</i> and <i>Plymouth</i> of the United States
Navy, under command of Commodore Perry.</p>

<p>Have you ever disturbed an ant-hill, and
seen the ants come running out in great haste
to learn what was wrong? It was much like
that on the Bay of Yeddo. Thousands of
Japanese gathered on the shores or rowed out
on the bay to gaze at this strange sight. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
great steamships, gliding on without sails,
were a wonderful spectacle to them.</p>

<p>As the ships came on, boats put out with
flags and carrying men who wore two swords.
This meant that they were of high station.
They wanted to climb into the ships and order
the daring commodore to turn around and go
back, but none of them were allowed to set foot
on board.</p>

<p>"Our commodore is a great dignitary," they
were told. "He cannot meet small folk like
you. He will only speak with one of your
great men, who is his equal."</p>

<p>And so the ropes which were fastened to the
ships were cut, and those who tried to climb on
board were driven back, and these two-sworded
people had to row away as they had come.</p>

<p>This made them think that the American
commodore must be a very big man indeed.
So a more important man came out; but he was
stopped too, and asked his business. He
showed an order for the ships to leave the harbor
at once, but was told that they had come
there on business and would not leave till their
business was done.</p>

<p>After some more talk they let this man come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
on board, but a lieutenant was sent to talk with
him as his equal in rank. He said he was the
vice-governor of the district, and that the law
of Japan forbade foreigners to come to any
port but that of Nagasaki, where the Dutch
traders came.</p>

<p>The lieutenant replied that such talk was not
respectful; that they had come with a letter
from the President of the United States to the
Emperor of Japan; and that they would deliver
it where they were and nowhere else. And it
would be given only to a prince of the highest
rank.</p>

<p>Then he was told that the armed boats that
were gathering about the ship must go away.
If they did not they would be driven away with
cannon. When the vice-governor heard this
he ordered the boats away, and soon followed
them himself. He was told that if the governor
did not receive the letter the ships would
go up the bay to Yeddo, the capital, and send
it up to the Emperor in his palace.</p>

<p>The next day the governor of the district
came. Two captains were sent to talk with
him. He did not want to receive the letter
either, and tried every way he could to avoid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
taking it. After some talk he asked if he
might have four days to send and get permission
of the Tycoon, who was the acting but not
the real emperor of Japan.</p>

<p>"No," he was told. "Three days will be
plenty of time, for Yeddo is not far off. If the
answer does not come then, we will steam up
to the city, and our commodore will go to the
Emperor's palace for the answer."</p>

<p>The governor was frightened at this, so he
agreed upon the three days and went ashore.</p>

<p>During those three days the ships were not
idle. They sent parties in boats to survey the
bay. All along the shores were villages full
of people, and fishing boats and trading vessels
were on the waters by hundreds. There were
forts on shore, but they were poor affairs, with
a few little cannon, and soldiers carrying
spears. And canvas was stretched from tree
to tree as if it would keep back cannon-balls.
The sailors laughed when they saw this.</p>

<p>The governor said that they ought not to
survey the waters; it was against the laws of
Japan. But they kept at it all the same. The
boats went ten miles up the bay, and the
<i>Mississippi</i> steamed after them. Government<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
boats came out, and signs were made for them
to go back; but they paid no attention to these
signs.</p>

<p>When the three days were ended the good
news came that the Emperor would receive the
letter. He would send one of his high officers
for it. An answer would be returned through
the Dutch or the Chinese. Commodore Perry
said this was an insult, and he would not take
an answer from them, but would come back
for it himself.</p>

<p>So, on the 14th of July the President's letter
was received. It was written in the most beautiful
manner, on the finest paper, and was in
a golden box of a thousand dollars in value.
It asked for a treaty of commerce between the
two countries, and for kind treatment of American
sailors.</p>

<p>So far none of the Japanese had seen the
Commodore, and they thought he must be a
very great man. Now he went ashore with
much dignity, with several hundred officers and
men, and with bands playing and cannon roaring.
There were two princes of the empire to
receive him, splendidly dressed in embroidered
robes of silk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>The Commodore was carried in a fine sedan-chair,
beside which walked two gigantic negroes,
dressed in gorgeous uniform and armed
with swords and pistols. Two other large,
handsome negroes carried the golden letter
case.</p>

<p>A beautiful scarlet box was brought by the
Japanese to receive this. It was put in the box
with much ceremony, and a receipt was given.
Then the interpreter said:</p>

<p>"Nothing more can be done now. The letter
has been received and you must leave."</p>

<p>"I shall come back for the answer," said
Commodore Perry.</p>

<p>"With all the ships?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and likely with more."</p>

<p>Not another word was said, and the Commodore
rose and returned to the ship. The
next day he sailed up the bay until only eight
or ten miles from the capital. On the 16th, the
Japanese officials were glad to see the foreign
ships, with their proud Commodore, sailing
away. The visit had caused them great anxiety
and trouble of mind.</p>

<p>Commodore Perry did not come back till
February of the next year. Then he had a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
larger fleet; nine ships in all. And he went
farther up the bay than before and anchored
opposite the village of Yokohama. This village
has now grown into a large city.</p>

<p>The Emperor's answer was ready, but there
was much ceremony before it was delivered.
There were several receptions, and at one of
these the presents which Commodore Perry
had brought were delivered. These were fine
cloths, firearms, plows, and various other articles.
The most valuable were a small locomotive
and a railroad car. These were run in a
circular track that was set up, and the Japanese
looked on with wonder. Also a telegraph wire
was set up and operated. This interested the
Japanese more than anything else, but they
took care not to show any surprise.</p>

<p>In the Emperor's reply, he agreed that the
American ships should be supplied with provisions
and water, and that shipwrecked sailors
should be kindly treated. And he also agreed
to open to American ships another port besides
that of Nagasaki, where the Dutch were received.
The Commodore was not satisfied with
this, and finally two new ports were opened to
American commerce. And the Americans were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
given much more freedom to go about than was
given to the Dutch or the Chinese. They
refused to be treated like slaves.</p>

<p>When it was all settled and the treaties were
exchanged, Commodore Perry gave an elegant
dinner on his flagship to the Japanese princes
and officials. They enjoyed the American food
greatly, but what they liked most was champagne
wine, which they had never tasted before.
One little Japanese got so merry with
drinking this, that he sprang up and embraced
the Commodore like a brother. Perry bore
this with great good-humor.</p>

<p>But just think of the importance of all this!
For three centuries the empire of Japan had
been shut like a locked box against the nations.
Now the box was unlocked, and the people of
the nations were free to come and go. For
treaties were soon made with other countries,
and the island empire was thrown open to the
commerce of the world.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>CAPTAIN INGRAHAM TEACHES AUSTRIA A LESSON</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Our Navy Upholds the Rights of an American in a Foreign Land</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>NOW I have a story to tell you about how
this country looks after its citizens
abroad. It is not a long story, but it is a
good one, and Americans have been proud of
Captain Ingraham ever since his gallant act.</div>

<p>In 1848 there was a great rebellion in Hungary
against Austria. Some terrible fighting
took place and then it was put down with much
cruelty and slaughter. The Austrian government
tried to seize all the leaders of the Hungarian
patriots and put them to death, but
several of them escaped to Turkey and took
refuge in the City of Smyrna. Among these
was the celebrated Louis Kossuth, and another
man named Koszta.</p>

<p>Austria asked Turkey to give these men up,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
but the Sultan of Turkey refused to do so.
Soon after that Koszta came to the United
States, and there in 1852 he took the first step
towards becoming an American citizen. He
was sure that the United States would take
care of its citizens. And he found out that it
would.</p>

<p>The next year he had to go back to Smyrna
on some business. That was not a safe place
for him. The Austrians hated him as they did
all the Hungarian patriots. They did not ask
Turkey again to give him up, but there was an
Austrian warship, the <i>Huszar</i>, in the harbor,
and a plot was made to seize Koszta and take
him on board this ship. Then he could easily
be carried to Austria and put to death as a
rebel.</p>

<p>One day, while Koszta was sitting quietly in
the Marina, a public place in Smyrna, he was
seized by a number of Greeks, who had been
hired to do so by the Austrian consul. They
bound him with ropes and carried him on board
the <i>Huszar</i>.</p>

<p>It looked bad now for poor Koszta, for he
was in the hands of his enemies. It is said
that the Archduke John, brother of the Emperor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
of Austria, was captain of the ship. By
his orders iron fetters were riveted on the
ankles and wrists of Koszta, and he was locked
up in the ship as one who had committed a
great crime.</p>

<p>But a piece of great good fortune for the
prisoner happened, for the next day the <i>St.
Louis</i>, an American sloop-of-war, came sailing
into the harbor. Captain Duncan N. Ingraham,
who had been a midshipman in the War
of 1812, was in command.</p>

<p>He was just the man to be there. He was
soon told what had taken place, and that the
prisoner claimed to be an American, and he at
once sent an officer to the <i>Huszar</i> and asked if
he could see Koszta. He was told that he
might do so.</p>

<p>Captain Ingraham went to the Austrian ship
and had an interview with the prisoner, who
told him his story, and said that he had taken
the first step to become a citizen of the United
States. He begged the captain to protect him.</p>

<p>Captain Ingraham was satisfied that Koszta
had a just claim to the protection of the American
flag, and asked the Austrians to release
him. They refused to do so, and he then wrote<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
to Mr. Brown, the American consul at Constantinople
and asked him what he should do.</p>

<p>Before he could get an answer a squadron
of Austrian warships, six in number, came
gliding into the harbor, and dropped anchor
near the <i>Huszar</i>. It looked worse than ever
now for poor Koszta, for what could the little
<i>St. Louis</i> do against seven big ships? But
Captain Ingraham did not let that trouble him.
In his mind right was stronger than might, and
he was ready to fight ten to one for the honor
of his flag.</p>

<p>While he was waiting for an answer from
Consul Brown he saw that the <i>Huszar</i> was
getting ready to leave the harbor. Her anchor
was drawn up and her sails were set. Ingraham
made up his mind that if the <i>Huszar</i> left,
it would have to be over the wreck of the <i>St.
Louis</i>. He spread his sails in a hurry and
drove his sloop-of-war right in the track of the
Austrian ship. Then he gave orders to his
men to make ready for a fight.</p>

<p>When Archduke John saw the gun-ports of
the <i>St. Louis</i> open he brought his ship to a
standstill and Captain Ingraham went on
board.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you intend to do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To sail for home," said the Austrian.
"Our consul orders us to take our prisoner to
Austria."</p>

<p>"You must pardon me," said Captain Ingraham,
"but if you try to leave this port with
that American I shall be compelled to resort to
extreme measures."</p>

<p>That was a polite way of saying that Koszta
should not be taken away if he could prevent it.</p>

<p>The Austrian looked at the six ships of his
nation that lay near him. Then he looked at
the one American ship. Then a pleasant smile
came on his face.</p>

<p>"I fear I shall have to go on, whether it is
to your liking or not," he said, in a very polite
tone.</p>

<p>Captain Ingraham made no answer. He
bowed to the Archduke and then descended
into his boat and returned to the <i>St. Louis</i>.</p>

<p>"Clear the ship for action!" he ordered. The
tars sprang to their stations, the ports were
opened, and the guns thrust out. There was
many a grim face behind them.</p>

<p>The Archduke stared when he saw these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
black-mouthed guns. He was in the wrong
and he knew it. And he saw that the American
meant business. He could soon settle the
little <i>St. Louis</i> with his seven ships. But the
great United States was behind that one ship,
and war might be behind all that.</p>

<p>So the Archduke took the wisest course,
turned his ship about, and sailed back. Then
he sent word to Ingraham that he would wait
till Consul Brown's answer came.</p>

<p>The Consul's reply came on July 1. It
said that Captain Ingraham had done just
right, and advised him to go on and stand for
the honor of his country.</p>

<p>The daring American now took a bold step.
He sent a note to the Archduke, demanding the
release of Koszta. And he said that if the
prisoner was not sent on board the <i>St. Louis</i>
by four o'clock the next afternoon, he would
take him from the Austrians by force of arms.</p>

<p>A refusal came back from the Austrian ship.
They would not give up their prisoner, they
said. Now it looked like war indeed. Captain
Ingraham waited till eight o'clock the next
morning, and then he had his decks cleared for
action and brought his guns to bear on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
<i>Huszar</i>. The seven Austrian ships turned
their guns on the <i>St. Louis</i>. The train was
laid; a spark might set it off.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock an Austrian officer came on
board the <i>St. Louis</i>. He began to talk round
the subject. Ingraham would not listen to him.
It must be one thing or nothing.</p>

<p>"All I will agree to is to have the man given
into the care of the French consul at Smyrna
till you can hear from your government," he
said. "But he must be delivered there or I
will take him. I have stated the time at four
o'clock this afternoon."</p>

<p>The Austrian went back. When twelve
o'clock came a boat left the <i>Huszar</i> and was
rowed in shore. An hour later the French
consul sent word to Captain Ingraham that
Koszta had been put under his charge. Captain
Ingraham had won. Soon after, several
of the Austrian ships got under way and left
the harbor. They had tried to scare Captain
Ingraham by a show of force, but they had
tried in vain.</p>

<p>When news of the event reached the United
States everybody cheered the spirit of Captain
Ingraham. He had given Europe a new idea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
of what the rights of an American citizen
meant. The diplomats now took up the case
and long letters passed between Vienna and
Washington. But in the end Austria acknowledged
that the United States was right, and
sent an apology.</p>

<p>As for Koszta, the American flag gave him
life and liberty. Since then American citizenship
has been respected everywhere.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>THE "MONITOR" AND THE "MERRIMAC"</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Fight Which Changed All Naval Warfare.</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>THE story I am now going to tell you
takes us forward to the beginning of the
great Civil War, that terrible conflict
which went on during four long years between
the people of the North and the South. Most
of this war was on land, but there were some
mighty battles at sea, and my story is of one
of the greatest of these.</div>

<p>You should know that up to 1860 all ocean
battles were fought by ships with wooden sides,
through which a ball from a great gun would
often cut as easily as a knife through a piece
of cheese. Some vessels had been built with
iron overcoats, but none of these had met in
war. It was not till March, 1862, that the first
battle between ships with iron sides took place.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Constitution</i>, you may remember, was
called the <i>Old Ironsides</i>, but that was only a
nickname, for she had wooden sides, and the
first real Ironsides were the <i>Monitor</i> and the
<i>Merrimac</i>.</p>

<p>Down in Virginia there is a great body of
salt water known as Hampton Roads. The
James River runs into it, and so does the Elizabeth
River, a small stream which flows past
the old City of Norfolk.</p>

<p>When the Civil War opened there was at
Norfolk a fine United States navy yard, with
ships and guns and docks that had cost a great
deal of money. But soon after the war began
the United States officers in charge there ran
away in a fright, having first set on fire everything
that would burn. Among the ships
there was the old frigate <i>Merrimac</i>, which was
being repaired. This was set on fire, and
blazed away brightly until it sank to the bottom
and the salt water put out the blaze. That
was a very bad business, for there was enough
left of the old <i>Merrimac</i> to make a great deal
of trouble for the United States.</p>

<p>What did the Confederates do but lift the
<i>Merrimac</i> out of the mud, and put her in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
dry dock, and cut away the burnt part, and
build over her a sloping roof of timbers two
feet thick, until she looked something like
Noah's ark. Then this was covered with iron
plates four inches thick. In that way the first
Confederate iron-clad ship was made.</p>

<p>The people at Washington knew all about
this ship and were very much alarmed. No one
could tell what dreadful damage it might do if
it got out to sea, and came up Chesapeake Bay
and the Potomac River to the national capital.
It might be much worse than when the British
burnt Washington in 1814, for Washington
was now a larger and finer city.</p>

<p>Something had to be done, and right away,
too. It would not do to wait for a monster
like the <i>Merrimac</i>. So Captain John Ericsson,
a famous engineer of New York, was ordered
to build an iron ship-of-war as fast as he could.
And he started to do so after a queer notion
of his own.</p>

<p>That is the way it came about that the two
iron ships were being built at once, one at Norfolk
and one at New York. And there was a
race between the builders, for the first one finished
would have the best chance. There was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
lively rattle of hammers and tongs at both
places, and it turned out that they were finished
and ready for service only a few days apart.</p>

<p>It was <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'necesary'">necessary</ins>  to tell you all this so that
you might know how the great fight came to be
fought, and how Washington was saved from
the iron dragon of the South. Now we are
done with our story of ship-building and must
go on to the story of battle and ruin.</p>

<p>On the morning of March 8, 1862, the sun
came up beautifully over the broad waters of
Hampton Roads. The bright sunbeams lit up
the sails of a row of stately vessels stretched
out for miles over the smiling bay. There were
five of these: the steam frigates <i>St. Lawrence</i>,
<i>Roanoke</i>, and <i>Minnesota</i>; the sailing frigate
<i>Congress</i>; and the sloop-of-war <i>Cumberland</i>.
They were all wooden ships, but were some of
the best men-of-war in the United States navy.</p>

<p>All was still and quiet that fine morning.
There was nothing to show that there was any
trouble on board those noble ships. But there
was alarm enough, for their captains knew
that the <i>Merrimac</i> was finished and might
come at any hour. Very likely some of the
officers thought that they could soon decide<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
matters for this clumsy iron monster. But I
fancy some of them did not sleep well and had
bad dreams when they thought of what might
happen.</p>

<p>Just at the hour of noon the lookout on the
<i>Cumberland</i> saw a long black line of smoke
coming from the way of Norfolk. Soon three
steamers were seen. One of these did not look
like a ship at all, but like a low black box,
from which the smoke puffed up in a thick
cloud.</p>

<p>But they knew very well what this odd-looking
craft was. It was the <i>Merrimac</i>. It
had come out for a trial trip. But it was a new
kind of trial its men were after: the trial by
battle.</p>

<p>Down came the iron-clad ship, with her
sloping roof black in the sunlight. Past the
<i>Congress</i> she went, both ships firing. But the
great guns of the <i>Congress</i> did no more harm
than so many pea-shooters; while the shot of
the <i>Merrimac</i> went clear through the wooden
ships, leaving death in their track.</p>

<p>Then the iron monster headed for the <i>Cumberland</i>.
That was a terrible hour for the men
on the neat little sloop-of-war. They worked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
for their lives, loading and firing, and firing as
fast as they could, but not a shot went through
that grim iron wall.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the <i>Merrimac</i> came gliding
up and struck the <i>Cumberland</i> a frightful blow
with her iron nose, tearing through the thick
oaken timbers and making a great hole in her
side. Then she backed off and the water
rushed in.</p>

<p>In a minute the good ship began to sink,
while the <i>Merrimac</i> poured shot and shell into
her wounded ribs.</p>

<p>"Do you surrender?" asked one of the officers
of the <i>Merrimac</i>.</p>

<p>"Never!" said Lieutenant Morris, who commanded
the <i>Cumberland</i>. "I'll sink alongside
before I pull down that flag."</p>

<p>He was a true Yankee seaman; one of the
"no surrender" kind.</p>

<p>Down, inch by inch, settled the doomed ship.
But her men stuck grimly to their guns, and
fired their last shot just as she sank out of
sight. Then all who had not saved themselves
in the boats leaped overboard and swam ashore,
but a great many of the dead and wounded
went down with the ship.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>She sank like a true Yankee hero, with her
flag flying, and when she struck bottom, with
only the tops of her masts above water, "Old
Glory" still fluttered proudly in the breeze.</p>

<p>That was the way it went when iron first
met wood in naval warfare. The victor now
turned to the <i>Congress</i> and another fierce battle
began. But the wooden ship had no chance.
For an hour her men fought bravely, but her
great guns were of no use, and a white flag was
raised. She had surrendered, but the Confederates
could not take possession, for there were
batteries on shore that drove them off. So
they fired hot shot into the <i>Congress</i> and soon
she was in a blaze.</p>

<p>It was now five o'clock in the afternoon, and
the <i>Merrimac</i> steamed away with the Confederate
flag flying in triumph. She had finished
her work for that day. It was a famous trial
trip. She would come back the next and sink
the vessels still afloat&mdash;if nothing hindered.</p>

<p>For hours that night the <i>Congress</i> blazed
like a mighty torch, the flames lighting up the
water and land for miles around. It was after
midnight when the fire reached her magazine
and she blew up with a terrific noise, scattering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
her timbers far and near. The men on the
<i>Merrimac</i> looked proudly at the burning ship.
It was a great triumph for them. But they
saw one thing by her light they did not like so
well. Off towards Fortress Monroe there lay
in the water a strange-looking thing, which
had not been there an hour before. What
queer low ship was that? And where had it
come from?</p>

<p>The sun rose on the morning of Sunday,
March 9, and an hour later the <i>Merrimac</i> was
again under way to finish her work. Not far
from where the <i>Congress</i> had burnt lay the
<i>Minnesota</i>. She had run aground and looked
like an easy prey. But close beside her was the
floating thing they had observed the night before,
the queerest-looking craft that had ever
been seen.</p>

<p>Everybody opened their eyes wide and stared
as at a show when they saw this strange object.
They called it "a cheese box on a raft," and
that was a good name for its queer appearance.
For the deck was nearly on a level with the
water, and over its centre rose something like
a round iron box. But it had two great guns
sticking out of its tough sides.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the <i>Monitor</i>, the new vessel which
Captain Ericsson had built and sent down to
fight the <i>Merrimac</i>. But none who saw this
little low thing thought it could stand long before
the great Confederate iron-clad. It looked
a little like a slim tiger or leopard before a
great rhinoceros or elephant. The men on the
<i>Merrimac</i> did not seem to think it worth minding,
for they came steaming up and began
firing at the <i>Minnesota</i> when they were a mile
away.</p>

<p>Then away from the side of the great frigate
glided the little <i>Monitor</i>, heading straight
for her clumsy antagonist. She looked like no
more than a mouthful for the big ship, and
men gazed at her with dread. She seemed
to be going straight to destruction.</p>

<p>But the brave fellows on the <i>Monitor</i> had
no such thoughts as that.</p>

<p>"Let her have it," said Captain Worden,
when they came near; and one of the great
eleven-inch guns boomed like a volcano. The
huge iron ball, weighing about 175 pounds,
struck the plates of the <i>Merrimac</i> with a thundering
crash, splitting and splintering them
before it bounded off. The broadside of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
<i>Merrimac</i> boomed back, but the balls glanced
away from the thick round sides of the turret
and did not harm.</p>

<p>Then the turret was whirled round like a
top, and the gun on the other side came round
and was fired. Again the <i>Merrimac</i> fired back,
and the great battle was on.</p>

<p>For two hours the iron ships fought like two
mighty wrestlers of the seas. Smoke filled the
turret so that the men of the <i>Monitor</i> did not
know how to aim their guns. The <i>Merrimac</i>
could fire three times to her one, but not a ball
took effect. It was like a battle in a cloud.</p>

<p>"Why are you not firing?" asked Lieutenant
Jones of a gun captain.</p>

<p>"Why, powder is getting scarce," he replied,
"and I find I can do that whiffet as much harm
by snapping my finger and thumb every three
minutes."</p>

<p>Then Lieutenant Jones tried to sink the
<i>Monitor</i>. Five times the great iron monster
came rushing up upon the little Yankee craft,
but each time it glided easily away. But when
the <i>Merrimac</i> came up the sixth time Captain
Worden did not try to escape. The <i>Monitor</i>
waited for the blow. Up rushed the <i>Merrimac</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
at full speed and struck her a fierce blow. But
the iron armor did not give way, and the great
ship rode up on the little one's deck till she
was lifted several feet.</p>

<p>The little <i>Monitor</i> sank down under the <i>Merrimac</i>
till the water washed across her deck;
then she slid lightly out and rose up all right
again, while the <i>Merrimac</i> started a leak in its
own bow. At the same moment one of the
<i>Monitor's</i> great guns was fired and the ball
struck the <i>Merrimac</i>, breaking the iron plates
and bulging in the thick wood backing.</p>

<p>Thus for hour after hour the fight went on.
For six hours the iron ships struggled and
fought, but neither ship was much the worse,
while nobody was badly hurt.</p>

<p>The end of the fight came in this way: There
was a little pilot-house on the deck of the
<i>Monitor</i>, with a slot in its side from which Captain
Worden watched what was going on, so
that he could give orders to his men. Up
against this there came a shell that filled the
face and eyes of the captain with grains of
powder and splinters of iron, and flung him
down blind and helpless. Blood poured from
every pore of his face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>The same shot knocked an iron plate from
the top of the pilot-house and let in the daylight
in a flood. When the light came pouring
in Captain Worden, with his blinded eyes,
thought something very serious had happened,
and gave orders for the <i>Monitor</i> to draw off to
see what damage was done.</p>

<p>Before she came back the <i>Merrimac</i> was far
away. She was leaking badly and her officers
thought it about time to steam away for home.</p>

<p>That was the end of the great battle.
Neither side had won the victory, but it was a
famous fight for all that. For it was the first
battle of iron-clad ships in the history of the
world. Since then no great warship has been
built without iron sides. Only small vessels
are now made all of wood.</p>

<p>That was the first and last battle of the
<i>Monitor</i> and the <i>Merrimac</i>. For a long time
they watched each other like two bull-dogs
ready for a fight. But neither came to blows.
Then, two months after the great battle, the
<i>Merrimac</i> was set on fire and blown up. The
Union forces were getting near Norfolk and
her officers were afraid she would be taken, so
they did what the Union officers had done
before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Monitor</i> had done her work well, but
her time also soon came. Ten months after
the great battle she was sent out to sea, and
there she went to the bottom in a gale. Such
was the fate of the pioneer iron-clads. But
they had fought a mighty fight, and had taught
the nations of the world a lesson they would
not soon forget.</p>

<p>In that grim deed between the first two iron-clad
ships a revolution took place in naval war.
The great frigates, with their long rows of
guns, were soon to be of little more use than
floating logs. More than forty years have
passed since then, and now all the great war-vessels
are clad in armor of the hardest steel.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>COMMODORE FARRAGUT WINS RENOWN</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Hero of Mobile Bay Lashes Himself to the Mast</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>AN old friend of ours is David G. Farragut.
We met him, you may remember, years
ago, on the old <i>Essex</i>, under Captain
Porter, when he was a boy of only about ten
years of age. Young as he was, he did good
work on that fine ship during her cruise in the
Pacific and her last great fight.</div>

<p>When the Civil War began Farragut had
got to be quite an old boy. He was sixty years
of age and a captain in the navy. He had
been born in the South and now lived in Virginia,
and the Confederates very much wanted
him to fight on their side.</p>

<p>"Not after fighting fifty years for the old
flag," he said. "And mind what I tell you;
you fellows will catch much more than you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
want before you get through with this business."</p>

<p>And so Farragut reported for duty under
the old flag.</p>

<p>Very soon the ships of the government were
busy all along the coast, blockading ports and
chasing blockade runners, and fighting wherever
they saw a chance.</p>

<p>One such chance, a big one, came away down
South. For there was the large City of New
Orleans, which the British had tried to take
nearly fifty years before; and there was the
Mississippi River that led straight to it. But
strong forts had been built along that river
and armed boats were on its waters, and the
Yankees of the North might find it as hard to
get there as the British did.</p>

<p>Now I have to speak of another brave man
and good seaman, David D. Porter. He was
a son of the captain of the old <i>Essex</i>, and a life-long
friend of David G. Farragut.</p>

<p>Porter was sent down to help blockade the
Mississippi in the summer of 1861, and while
there he found out all about the forts and the
ships on the river. Then he went to Washington
and told the Secretary of the Navy all he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
had learned, and asked him to send down a
fleet to try to capture the city.</p>

<p>"Where can I find the right man for a big
job like that?" asked the Secretary.</p>

<p>"Captain Farragut is your man," said Porter.
"You have him now on committee work,
where a man like him is just wasted, for you
have not half as good a seaman on any of your
ships."</p>

<p>And in that way the gallant Farragut was
chosen to command the fleet to be sent to capture
the great city of the South. Porter, you
see, did not ask for a command for himself, but
for his friend.</p>

<p>When the fleet was got ready it numbered
nearly twenty vessels, but most of them were
gunboats, and none of them were very large.
The Mississippi was not the place for very
large ships. Farragut chose the sloop-of-war
<i>Hartford</i> for his flagship and sailed merrily
away for the mighty river. He did not forget
his friend Porter. For twenty mortar boats
were added to the fleet, and Porter was given
command of these.</p>

<p>A mortar, you should know, is a kind of a
short cannon made to throw large shells or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
balls. It is pointed upward so as to throw them
high up into the air and then let them fall
straight down on a fort. Porter's mortar boats
were schooners that carried cannons of this
kind.</p>

<p>When Farragut had sailed his fleet into the
river, he made ready for the great fight before
him. Of course, he had no iron-clads, for the
<i>Monitor</i> had just fought its great battle and
no other iron-clads had been built. So he
stretched iron chains up and down the sides of
his ships to stop cannon balls. Then bags of
coal and sand were piled round the boilers and
engines to keep them safe, and nets were hung
to catch flying splinters, which, in a fight at
sea, are often worse than bullets.</p>

<p>But the most interesting thing done was to
the mortar boats. These were to be anchored
down the stream below the forts, and limbs of
trees full of green leaves were tied on their
masts, so they could not be told from the trees
on the river-bank. As they went up the river
they looked like a green grove afloat.</p>

<p>Now let us take a look at what the Confederates
were doing. They were not asleep, you
may be sure. They had built two strong forts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
one on each side of the river, just where
it made a sharp bend. One of these was
named Fort Jackson and the other Fort St.
Philip. There were more than a hundred
cannon in these forts, but most of them were
small ones.</p>

<p>They had also stretched iron cables across
the river, with rafts and small vessels to hold
them up. These were to stop the fleet from
going up the river, and to hold it fast while the
forts could pour shot and shell into it. They
had also many steamboats with cannon on
them. One of these, the <i>Louisiana</i>, was covered
with iron. Another was a ram, called the
<i>Manassas</i>. This had a sharp iron beak, to ram
and sink other vessels. And there were great
coal barges, filled with fat pine knots. These
were meant for fire-ships. You will learn farther
on how these were to be used.</p>

<p>You may see from this that Farragut had
some hard work before him. Even if he got
past the chains and the forts, all his ships
might be set on fire by the fire-ships. But the
bold captain was not one of the kind that
mind things like that. Now let us go on to
the story of the terrible river fight, which has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
long been one of the most famous battles of
the war.</p>

<p>Porter's mortar boats were anchored under
the trees on the river-bank, two miles below
the forts. With their green-clad masts they
looked like trees themselves. At ten o'clock in
the morning of April 18, 1862, the first mortar
sent its big shell whizzing through the air.
And for six days this was kept up, each of the
mortars booming out once every ten minutes.
That made one shot for every half-minute.</p>

<p>Two days after the mortars began, a bold
thing was done. The gunboat <i>Itasca</i> set out in
the darkness of the night and managed to get
between the shore and the chain. Then it ran
up stream above the chain till it got a good
headway. It now turned round and came down
at full speed before the strong current.</p>

<p>Fort Jackson was firing, and balls were rattling
all about the bold <i>Itasca</i>, but she rushed
on through them all. Plump against the chain
she came, with a thud that lifted her three feet
out of the water. Then the chain snapped in
two and away went the <i>Itasca</i> down stream.
The barrier was broken and the way to New
Orleans lay open before the fleet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 23d of April Farragut gave his orders
to the captains of the fleet. That night
they were to try to pass the forts and fight
their way to New Orleans. At two o'clock in
the morning came the welcome order, "All
hands up anchor!" and at three o'clock all was
ready for the start.</p>

<p>The night was dark, but on the banks near
Fort Jackson there was a blazing wood fire,
that threw its light across the stream. And
Porter's bombs were being fired as fast as the
men could drop the balls into them, so that
there was a great arch of fiery shells between
the mortar boats and the forts.</p>

<p>The gunboat <i>Cayuga</i> led the way through
the broken barrier. After her came the <i>Pensacola</i>,
one of the large vessels. All this time
the forts had kept still, but now they blazed
out with all their guns, and the air was full of
the booming of cannon and the screeching of
shells from forts and ships.</p>

<p>Great piles of wood were kindled on the
banks, and the fire-ships up stream were sent
blazing down the river as the steam vessels
came rushing up into the fire of the forts.
Never had the Mississippi seen so terrible a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
night. The blazing wood and flashing guns
made it as light as day, and the roar was like
ten thunderstorms.</p>

<p>Soon the <i>Hartford</i> came on, with Farragut
on her deck. So thick was the smoke that she
ran aground, and before she could get off a
fire-ship came blazing down against her side,
pushed by a tug-boat straight on to her. In a
minute the paint on the ship's side was in a
blaze and the flames shot up half as high as
the masts. The men at the guns drew back
from the scorching heat.</p>

<p>"Don't flinch from that blaze, boys," cried
Farragut. "Those who don't do their duty
here will find a hotter fire than that."</p>

<p>For a brief time the good ship was in great
danger. But a shower of shells sent the daring
tug-boat to the bottom, and the fire-ship
floated away. Then a hose-pipe spurted water
on the flames. The fire was put out and the
<i>Hartford</i> was saved.</p>

<p>That was only the beginning of the great
battle. From that time on, fire and flame,
boom and roar, death and destruction, were
everywhere. The great shells from the mortars
dropped bursting into the forts. The huge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
wood piles blazed high on the banks. Ships
and forts hurled a frightful shower of shells
at each other. Blazing fire-ships came drifting
down. The foremost boats were fiercely fighting
with the Confederate craft. The hindmost
boats were fighting with the forts. The uproar
seemed enough to drive the very moon
from the sky.</p>

<p>But soon victory began to hold out her hand
to the Union fleet. For all the ships passed
the forts, some of the Confederate vessels were
driven ashore and others fled up stream; and in
a little while only three of them were left, and
these were kept safe under the guns of the
fort. The battle had been fought and won,
and the triumphant fleet steamed up the river
to New Orleans. The forts were still there,
but what could they do, with Union forces
above and below? Four days after the fight
they were surrendered to Porter and his mortar
fleet.</p>

<p>There was one final act to the great Mississippi
battle. For as Commander Porter, in his
flagship, lay near Fort Jackson, down on him
came the iron-clad <i>Louisiana</i>, all in a blaze.
But just before she reached his vessel she blew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
up; and that was the end of the <i>Louisiana</i> and
the fight. The river was open and New Orleans
was captured. Thus ended the greatest
naval battle of the Civil War.</p>

<p>Two years and more afterward Farragut
fought another great battle. This was in the
Bay of Mobile, then a great place for blockade-runners.
These were swift vessels that
brought goods from Europe to the South. The
Union fleet did all it could to stop them, but
they could not be stopped at Mobile from outside,
so Farragut was told to fight his way
inside the bay. And that is what he did.</p>

<p>Mobile Bay is like a great bell, thirty miles
long and fifteen miles wide. There are two
islands at the mouth, so that the entrance is
not more than a mile wide. And on each of
these islands was a strong fort, which had
been built by the government before the war.
The Confederates had taken possession of
these forts and had big guns in them.</p>

<p>The first thing to do was to pass the forts.
No chain could be put across the channel here,
but there was something worse, for nearly two
hundred torpedoes were planted in the water
near the forts. Some of these were made of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
beer-kegs and some of tin; and they were
planted so thickly that it was not easy to get
in without setting them off. Then, when the
fort and the torpedoes were passed, there were
the ships. Three of these were small gunboats,
of not much account. But there was a great
iron-clad ship, the <i>Tennessee</i>, which was twice
as strong as the <i>Merrimac</i>. It was covered
with iron five or six inches thick, and carried a
half-dozen big guns.</p>

<p>Franklin Buchanan, who had been captain
of the <i>Merrimac</i>, was admiral of the <i>Tennessee</i>.</p>

<p>But Admiral Farragut&mdash;he was an admiral
now&mdash;had his iron-clad vessels, too. Four monitors
like the old <i>Monitor</i> of Hampton Roads,
had been built and sent him, and these, with
his wooden vessels, made nearly twenty ships.</p>

<p>Such was the fleet with which Farragut set
out for his second great victory, early in the
morning of August 5, 1864. It was six o'clock
when the ships crossed the bar and headed in
for Fort Morgan.</p>

<p>On they went, bravely, firing at the fort.
But not a shot came back till the leading ships
were in front of its strong stone walls. Then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
there began a terrible roar, and a storm of iron
balls poured out at the ships. If the guns had
been well aimed, dreadful work might have
been done, but the balls went screaming
through the air and hardly touched a ship.
And the fierce fire from the ships drove many
of the men in the fort from their guns.</p>

<p>But now there is a terrible tale to tell, a tale
of death and destruction, of the sinking of a
ship with her captain and nearly all her crew
on board.</p>

<p>This was the monitor <i>Tecumseh</i>. It was
steered straight out where the torpedoes lay
thick. Suddenly there came a dull roar. The
bow of the iron-clad was lifted like a feather
out of the water. Then it sank till it pointed
downward like a boy diving, and the stern was
lifted up into the air. In a second more the
good ship went down with a mighty plunge.</p>

<p>But with this there is also one fine story, the
story of a gallant man. This was Captain
Craven, of the <i>Tecumseh</i>. He and the pilot
were in the pilot-house and both sprang for
the opening. But there was room only for one.
The brave captain drew back.</p>

<p>"After you, pilot," he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>The pilot escaped, but the noble captain,
with ninety-two of his men, sank to the depths.</p>

<p>A boat was sent to pick up the swimmers,
with a gallant young ensign, H. C. Neilds, in
charge. Out they rowed where the waters
were being torn and threshed with shot and
shell. The ensign was only a boy, but he had
the spirit of a Perry. He saw that his flag
was not flying, and he coolly raised it in the
face of the foe, and then sat down to steer.</p>

<p>Brave men were there by the hundreds, but
none were braver than their admiral, their immortal
Farragut. The smoke blinded his eyes
on deck, so he climbed to the top of the mainmast,
and there, lashed to the rigging, he went
in through the thick of the fire. Shells
screeched past him, great iron balls hustled
by his ears, but not a quiver came over his
noble face. He had to be where he could
see, he said. Danger did not count where
duty called.</p>

<p>On past the forts went ships and monitors,
heedless of torpedoes or of the fate of the <i>Tecumseh</i>.
Only one captain showed the white
feather. The <i>Brooklyn</i> held back.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" screamed Farragut.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"Torpedoes," was the only word that reached
his ears.</p>

<p>The gallant admiral then used a strong
word. It was not a word to be used in polite
society. But we must remember that battle
was raging about him and he was in a fury.</p>

<p>"Damn the torpedoes!" he cried. "Follow
me!"</p>

<p>Straight on the good ship sailed, right for
the nest of torpedoes, with the admiral in the
shrouds.</p>

<p>In a minute more the <i>Hartford</i> was among
them. They could be heard striking against
her bottom. Their percussion caps snapped,
but not one went off. Their tin cases had
rusted and they were spoiled. Only one of
them all went off that dreadful day of battle.
That saved many of the ships.</p>

<p>The fort and the torpedoes were passed, but
the Confederate ships remained. It did not
take long to settle for the gunboats, but the
iron-clad <i>Tennessee</i> remained. Putting on all
steam, this great ship ran down on the Union
fleet. Through the whole line it went and on
to the fort. But it was as slow as a tub and
the ships were easily kept out of its way.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, when the men were at breakfast, back
again came the <i>Tennessee</i>. They left their
coffee and ran to their guns. It was like the
old story of the <i>Merrimac</i> and the wooden
ships in Hampton Roads.</p>

<p>But Farragut did not wait to be rammed by
the <i>Tennessee</i>. If ramming was to be done he
wanted to do it himself. So all the large vessels
steamed head on for the iron-clad, butting
her right and left. They hit one another, too,
and the <i>Hartford</i> came near being sunk. Then
came the monitors, as the first <i>Monitor</i> had
come against the <i>Merrimac</i>. There were three
of these left, but one did the work, the <i>Chickasaw</i>.
She clung like a burr to the <i>Tennessee</i>,
pouring in her great iron balls, and doing so
much damage that soon the great ship was like
a floating hulk. It could not be steered nor its
guns fired.</p>

<p>For twenty minutes it stood this dreadful
hammering, and then its flag came down. The
battle was won.</p>

<p>"It was the most desperate battle I ever
fought since the days of the old <i>Essex</i>," said
Farragut.</p>

<p>The figure of the brave admiral in the rigging,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
fighting his ship amid a cyclone of shot
and shell, made him the hero of the American
people. It was like Dewey on the bridge in
Manila Bay in a later war. There was no
rank high enough in the navy to fit the glory
he had won, so one was made for him, the rank
of admiral. There was rear-admiral and vice-admiral,
but admiral was new and higher still.
Only two men have held this rank since his
day, his good friend and comrade, David D.
Porter, and the brave George Dewey.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>A RIVER FLEET IN A HAIL OF FIRE</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Admiral Porter Runs by the Forts in a Novel Way</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>OF course you know what a tremendous
task the North had before it in the Civil
War. The war between the North and
the South was like a battle of giants. And in
this vast contest the navy had to do its share,
both out at sea and on the rivers of the country.
One of its big bits of work was to cut off the
left arm of the Confederacy, and leave it only
its right arm to fight with.</div>

<p>By the left arm I mean the three states west
of the Mississippi River, and by the right arm,
the eight states east of that great river. To
cut off this left arm the government had to get
control of the whole river, from St. Louis to
the Gulf, so that no Confederate troops could
cross the great stream.</p>

<p>You have read how Farragut and Porter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
began this work, by capturing New Orleans
and all the river below it. And they went far
up the river, too. But in the end such great
forts were built at Vicksburg and Port Hudson
and other points that the Confederate government
held the river in a tight grasp.</p>

<p>In this way the Confederacy became master
of the Mississippi for a thousand miles. We
are to see now how it was taken from their
grasp.</p>

<p>James B. Eads, the engineer who built the
great railroad bridge over the Mississippi at
St. Louis, made the first iron-clads for the
West. There were seven of these. They were
river steamers, and were covered with iron, but
it was not very thick. Two others were afterward built,
making nine in all.</p>

<p>Each of these boats had thirteen guns, and
they did good work in helping the army to capture
two strong Confederate forts in Kentucky.
Then they went down the Mississippi to an
island that was called Island No. 10. It was
covered with forts, stretching one after another
all along its shore.</p>

<p>A number of mortar boats were brought
down and threw shells into the forts till they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
were half paved with iron. But all that did
no good. Then Admiral Foote was asked to
send one of the boats down past the forts.</p>

<p>That was dreadfully dangerous work, for
there were guns enough in them to sink twenty
such boats. But Captain Walke thought he
could take his boat, the <i>Carondelet</i>, down, and
the admiral told him he might try.</p>

<p>What was the <i>Carondelet</i> like, do you ask?
Well, she was a long, wide boat, with sloping
sides and a flat roof, and was covered with iron
two and a half inches thick. Four of her guns
peeped out from each side, while three looked
out from the front door, and two from the
back door of the boat.</p>

<p>Captain Walke did not half expect to get
through the iron storm from the forts. To
make his boat stronger, extra planks were laid
on her deck and chain cables were drawn
tightly across it. Then lumber was heaped
thickly round the boiler and engines, and ropes
were wrapped round and round the pilot-house
till they were eighteen inches thick.</p>

<p>After that a barge filled with bales of hay
was tied fast to the side that would catch the
fire of the forts. Something was done also to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
stop the noise of the steam pipes, for Captain
Walke thought he might slip down at night
without being seen or heard.</p>

<p>On the night of April 10, 1862, the boat
made its dash down stream. It started just as
a heavy thunderstorm came on. The wind
whistled, the rain poured down in sheets, and
the men in the forts hid from the storm. They
were not thinking then of runaway gunboats.</p>

<p>But something nobody had thought of now
took place. The blazing wood in the furnaces
set fire to the soot in the chimneys, and in a
minute the boat was like a great flaming torch.
As the men in the forts sprang up, the lightning
flashed out on the clouds, and lit up "the
gallant little ship floating past like a phantom."</p>

<p>The gunners did not mind the rain any more.
They ran in great haste to their guns, and soon
the batteries were flaming and roaring louder
than the thunder itself.</p>

<p>Fort after fort took it up as the <i>Carondelet</i>
slid swiftly past. The lightning and the blazing
smoke-stack showed her plainly to the gunners.
But the bright flashes blinded their eyes
so that they could not half aim their guns. And
thus it was that the brave little <i>Carondelet</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
went under the fire of fifty guns without being
harmed.</p>

<p>Soon after that Island No. 10 was given up
to the Union forces. Then the gunboats went
farther down the river, and had two hard fights
with Confederate boats, one at Fort Pillow and
one at Memphis. Both these places were captured,
and in that way the river was opened
all the way from St. Louis to Vicksburg.</p>

<p>The City of Vicksburg is in the State of Mississippi,
about two hundred miles above New
Orleans. Here are high river banks; and these
were covered thick with forts, so that Vicksburg
was the strongest place along the whole
stream.</p>

<p>There were also strong forts at Port Hudson,
about seventy-five miles below Vicksburg;
and these seventy-five miles were all the Confederates
now held of the great stream. But
they held these with a very strong hand and
were not to let go easily.</p>

<p>There were some great events at Vicksburg;
and I must tell about a few of these next.</p>

<p>After New Orleans was taken Farragut took
his ships up the river, running past the forts.
He could easily have taken Vicksburg then, if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
he had had any soldiers. But he had none, and
it took a great army of soldiers, under General
Grant, to capture it a year afterward.</p>

<p>David D. Porter, who had helped Farragut
so well in his great fight, was put in command
of the Mississippi fleet. He had a number of
iron-clad boats under him, some of them having
iron so thin that they were called tin-clads.</p>

<p>Commodore Porter had plenty to do. Now
he sent his boats up through the Yazoo
swamps, then they had a fight on the Arkansas
River; and in this way he was kept busy.</p>

<p>In February, 1863, he sent two of his boats,
the <i>Queen of the West</i> and the <i>Indianola</i>, down
past the Vicksburg forts. That was an easy
run. There was plenty of firing, but nobody
was hurt. But after they got below they found
trouble enough.</p>

<p>First, the <i>Queen of the West</i> ran aground
and could not be got off. Then the <i>Indianola</i>
had a hole rammed in her side by a Confederate
boat and went to the bottom. So there
wasn't much gained by sending these two boats
down stream.</p>

<p>But a curious thing took place. The Confederates
got the <i>Queen of the West</i> off the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
mud, and tried to raise the <i>Indianola</i> and stop
its leaks.</p>

<p>While they were hard at work at this they
heard a frightful roar from the Vicksburg batteries.
Looking up stream they saw a big
boat coming down upon them at full speed.
When they saw this they put the two big guns
of the <i>Indianola</i> mouth to mouth, fired them
into each other to ruin them, and then ran
away. But weren't they vexed afterward when
they learned that the boat that scared them was
only a dummy which Porter's men had sent
down the river in a frolic.</p>

<p>After that, the river batteries did not give
the ships much trouble. When the right time
came Porter's fleet ran down the river through
the fire of all the forts. One boat caught fire
and sank, but all the rest passed safely through.
This was done to help General Grant, who was
marching his army down, to get below Vicksburg.</p>

<p>I suppose all readers of American history
know about the great event of the 4th of July,
1863. On that day Vicksburg was given up
to the Union forces, with all its forts and all
its men. Five days afterward Port Hudson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
surrendered. Porter and his boats now held
the great river through all its length.</p>

<p>But there is something more to tell about
Admiral Porter, who was a rear-admiral now.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1864 General Banks was
sent with an army up the Red River. He was
going to Shreveport, which is about four hundred
miles above where the Red River runs
into the Mississippi. Porter went along with
his river fleet to help.</p>

<p>Now, no more need be said about Banks and
his army, except that the whole expedition
was only a waste of time, for it did no good;
and there would be nothing to say about Porter
and his fleet, if they had not gotten into a bad
scrape which gave them hard work to get out.</p>

<p>The boats went up the river easily enough,
but when they tried to come down they found
themselves in a trap. For after they had gone
up, the river began to fall and the water came
to be very low.</p>

<p>There are two rapids, or small falls, on this
part of the Red River, which show only at low
water. They showed plainly enough now; and
there were twelve of the boats above them,
caught fast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>What was to be done? If they tried to run
down the falls they would be smashed into
kindling wood. It looked very much as if they
would have to be left for the Confederates, or
set on fire and burned.</p>

<p>By good luck there was one man there who
knew what to do. He was a lieutenant-colonel
from Wisconsin, named Joseph Baily. He had
been a log-driver before the war and knew
what was done when logs got jammed in a
stream.</p>

<p>When he told his plan he was laughed at by
some who thought it very foolish, but Porter
told him to go ahead. So, with 2,000 soldiers
from Maine, who knew all about logging, he
went into the woods, chopped down trees, and
built a dam below the falls.</p>

<p>The men worked so hard that it took them
only eight days to build the dam; which was
wonderfully quick work. A place was left open
in the center, and there four barges loaded with
brick were sunk.</p>

<p>When the dam was finished it lifted the
water six feet higher, and down in safety went
three of the steamers, while the army shouted
and cheered. But just then two of the sunken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
barges were carried away, and the water
poured through the break in a flood.</p>

<p>The gunboat <i>Lexington</i> was just ready to
start. Admiral Porter stood on the bank
watching.</p>

<p>"Go ahead!" he shouted.</p>

<p>At once the engines were started and the
<i>Lexington</i> shot down the foaming rapid.
There were no cheers now; everybody was
still.</p>

<p>Down she went, rolling and leaping on the
wild waters; but soon she shot safe into the
still pool below. All the other vessels were
also safely taken down.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>THE SINKING OF THE "ALBEMARLE"</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lieutenant Cushing Performs the Most Gallant Deed of the Civil War</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>NOW I am going to tell you about one of
the most gallant deeds done in the navy
during the whole Civil War. The man
who did it was brave enough to be made admiral
of the fleet, yet he did not get even a gold
medal for his deed. But he is one of our
heroes. It is all about an iron-clad steamer,
and how it was sent to rest in the mud of a
river-bottom.</div>

<p>The Confederate government had very bad
luck with its iron-clads. It was busy enough
building them, but they did not pay for their
cost. The <i>Merrimac</i> did the most harm, but it
soon went up in fire and smoke.</p>

<p>Then there were the <i>Louisiana</i> at New Orleans,
and the <i>Tennessee</i> at Mobile. Farragut
made short work of them. Two were built at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
Charleston which were of little use. The last
of them all was the <i>Albemarle</i>, whose story I
am about to tell.</p>

<p>The Roanoke River, in North Carolina, was
a fine stream for blockade-runners. There was
a long line of ships and gunboats outside, but
in spite of them these swift runaways kept
dashing in, loaded with goods for the people.
Poor people! they needed them badly enough,
for they had little of anything except what they
could raise in their fields.</p>

<p>But the gunboats kept pushing farther into
the river, and gave the Confederates no end of
trouble. So they began to build an iron-clad
which they thought could drive these wooden
wasps away.</p>

<p>This iron-clad was a queer ship. Its keel
was laid in a cornfield; its bolts and bars were
hammered out in a blacksmith shop. Iron for
its engines was picked up from the scrap heaps
of the iron works at Richmond. Some of the
Confederates laughed at it themselves; but they
deserved great credit for building a ship under
such difficulties as these.</p>

<p>It was finished in April, 1864, and nobody
laughed at it when they saw it afloat. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
like the <i>Merrimac</i> in shape, and was covered
with iron four inches thick. They named it
the <i>Albemarle</i>.</p>

<p>Very soon the <i>Albemarle</i> showed that it was
no laughing matter. It sunk one gunboat and
made another run away in great haste. Then
it had a fight with four of them at once and
drove one of these lame and limping away.
The others did not come too near. After that
it went back to the town of Plymouth and was
tied up at the wharf.</p>

<p>There was another iron-clad being built, and
the <i>Albemarle</i> was kept waiting, so that the
two could work together. That was a bad
thing for the <i>Albemarle</i>, for she never went out
again.</p>

<p>This brings us back to the gallant deed I
spoke of, and the gallant fellow who did the
deed. His name was William B. Cushing. He
was little more than a boy, just twenty-one
years old, but he did not know what it meant
to be afraid, and he had done so many daring
things already that he had been made a lieutenant.</p>

<p>He wanted to try to destroy the <i>Albemarle</i>,
and his captain, who knew how bold a fellow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
he was, told him to go ahead and do his
best.</p>

<p>So on a dark night in October, 1864, brave
young Cushing started up the river in a steam
launch, with men and guns. At the bow of this
launch was a long spar, and at the end of this
spar was a torpedo holding a hundred pounds
of dynamite. There was a trigger and a cap
to set this off, a string to lower the spar and
another to pull the trigger. But it was a
poor affair to send on such an expedition as
that.</p>

<p>And this was not the worst. Some of the
newspapers had found out what Cushing was
going to do, and printed the whole story. And
some of these newspapers got down South and
let out the secret. That is what is called "newspaper
enterprise." It is very good in its right
place, but it was a sort of enterprise that nearly
spoiled Cushing's plans.</p>

<p>For the Confederates put lines of sentries
along the river, and stationed a lookout down
the stream, and placed a whole regiment of soldiers
near the wharf. And logs were chained
fast around the vessel so that no torpedo spar
could reach her. And the men on board were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
sharply on the watch. That is what the newspapers
did for Lieutenant Cushing.</p>

<p>Of course, the young lieutenant did not know
all this, and he felt full of hope as his boat went
up stream without being seen or heard. The
night was very dark and there were no lights
on board, and the engines were new and made
no noise.</p>

<p>So he passed the lookout in the river and the
sentries on the banks without an eye seeing
him or his boat.</p>

<p>But when he came up to the iron-clad his
hopes went down. For there was the boom of
logs so far out that his spar could not reach
her.</p>

<p>What was he to do? Should he land at the
wharf and take his men on board, and try to
capture her where she lay?</p>

<p>Before he had time to think it was too late
for that. A sentry on board saw the launch
and called out:</p>

<p>"Boat ahoy!" There was no answer.</p>

<p>"What boat is that?" Still no answer.</p>

<p>Then came a musket shot, and then a rattle
of musketry from the river bank. A minute
after lights flashed out and men came running<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
down the wharf. The ship's crew tumbled up
from below. All was haste and confusion.</p>

<p>Almost any man would have given it up for
lost and run for safety. But Cushing was not
of that kind. It did not take him a second to
decide. He ran the launch out into the stream,
turned her round, and dashed at full speed
straight for the boom.</p>

<p>A storm of bullets came from the deck of the
<i>Albemarle</i>, but he heeded them no more than
if they had been snowflakes. In a minute the
bow of the launch struck the logs.</p>

<p>They were slippery with river slime and the
light boat climbed up on them, driving them
down under the water. Over she went, and
slid into the water inside the boom.</p>

<p>Cushing stood in the bow, with the trigger-string
in his hand. He lowered the torpedo
under the hull of the iron-clad, lifted it till he
felt it touch her bottom, and then pulled the
string.</p>

<p>There came two loud reports. A hundred-pounder
gun was being fired from the ship's
side right over his head. Along with it came
a dull roar from under the water. The dynamite
torpedo had gone off, tearing a great hole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
in the wooden bottom. In a minute the ill-fated
<i>Albemarle</i> began to sink.</p>

<p>The launch was fast inside the boom, and the
wave from her torpedo was rushing over her,
carrying her down.</p>

<p>"Surrender," came a voice from above.</p>

<p>"Never! Swim for your lives, men," cried
Cushing, and he sprang into the flowing
stream.</p>

<p>Two or three bullets had gone through his
clothing, but he was unhurt, and swam swiftly
away, his men after him.</p>

<p>Only Cushing and one of the men got away.
The others were captured, except one who was
drowned. Boats were quickly out, a fire of
logs was made on the wharf, which threw its
light far out over the stream, but he reached
the shore unseen, chilled to the bone and completely
worn out.</p>

<p>A sentry was pacing on the wall of a fort
over his head, men passed looking for him, but
he managed to creep to the swamp nearby and
hide in the mud and reeds.</p>

<p>There he lay till the break of day. Then he
crawled on till he got into a cornfield nearby.
Now for the first time he could stand up and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
walk. But just as he got to the other side of
the field he came face to face with a man.</p>

<p>Cushing was not afraid. It was a black face.
In those days no Union soldier was afraid of
a black face. The slaves would do anything
for "Massa Linkums' sojers." The young
lieutenant was almost as black as the slave
after his long crawl through the mud.</p>

<p>Cushing told him who he was, and sent him
into the town for news, waiting in the cornfield
for his return. After an hour the messenger
came back. His face was smiling with
delight.</p>

<p>"Good news, Massa," he said. "De big iron
ship's gone to de bottom suah. Folks dar say
she'll neber git up agin."</p>

<p>"Mighty good," said Cushing. "Now, old
man, tell me how I can get back to the ships."</p>

<p>The negro told him all he could, and with a
warm "Good-bye" the fugitive took to the
swamp again. On he went, hour by hour,
forcing his way through the thick bushes and
wading in the deep mud. Thus he went on,
mile after mile, until at length, at two o'clock
in the afternoon, he found himself on the banks
of a narrow creek.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>Here he heard voices and drew back. Looking
through the bushes he saw a party of seven
soldiers just landing from a boat. They tied
the boat to the root of a tree and went up a
path that led back from the river. Soon they
stopped, sat down, and began to eat their dinner.
They could see their boat from where
they sat, but they were too busy eating to think
of that.</p>

<p>Here was Cushing's chance. It was a desperate
one, but he was ready to try anything.
He lowered himself quietly into the stream,
swam across, and untied the boat. Then he
noiselessly pushed it out and swam with it
down stream. As soon as he was out of sight
of the soldiers he climbed in and rowed away
as fast as he could. What the soldiers thought
and said when they missed their boat nobody
knows. He did not see them again.</p>

<p>It was a long journey. The creek was
crooked and winding. Night came on before
he reached the river. Then he paddled on till
midnight. Ten hours of hard toil had passed
when he saw the dark hull of a gunboat nearby.</p>

<p>"Ship ahoy!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Who goes there?" called the lookout.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>"A friend. Take me up."</p>

<p>A boat was lowered and rowed towards him.
The officer in it looked with surprise when he
saw a mud-covered man, with scratched and
bleeding face.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Cushing, or what is left of him."</p>

<p>"Cushing!&mdash;and how about the <i>Albemarle</i>?"</p>

<p>"She will never trouble Uncle Sam's ships
again. She lies in her muddy grave on the
bottom of the Roanoke."</p>

<p>Cheers followed this welcome news, and
when the gallant lieutenant was safe on board
the <i>Valley City</i> the cheers grew tenfold.</p>

<p>For Lieutenant Cushing had done a deed
which was matched for daring only once in the
history of our navy, and that was when Decatur
burned the <i>Philadelphia</i> in the harbor of
Tripoli.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h3>HOW THE "GLOUCESTER" REVENGED THE SINKING OF THE "MAINE"</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Deadly and Heroic Deeds in the War With Spain</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>IF you look at a map of the country we dwell
in, you will see that it has a finger pointing
south. That finger is called Florida, and
it points to the beautiful island of Cuba, which
spreads out there to right and left across the
sea of the South.</div>

<p>The Spaniards in Cuba were very angry
when they found the United States trying to
stop the war which they had carried on so
mercilessly. They thought this country had
nothing to do with their affairs. And in Havana,
the capital city of the island, riots broke
out and Americans were insulted.</p>

<p>Never before in the history of the United
States navy had there been so terrible a disaster
as the sinking of the <i>Maine</i> by a frightful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
and deadly explosion in the harbor of Havana,
Cuba, on February 15, 1898, and never was
there greater grief and indignation in the
United States than when the story was told.</p>

<p>Do you know what followed this dreadful
disaster? But of course you do, for it seems
almost yesterday that the <i>Maine</i> went down
with her slaughtered crew. Everybody said
that the Spaniards had done this terrible deed
and Spain should pay for it. We all said so
and thought so, you and I and all true Americans.</p>

<p>Before the loss of the <i>Maine</i> many people
thought we ought to go to war with Spain, and
put an end to the cruelty with which the Cubans
were treated. After her loss there were
not many who thought we ought not to. Our
people were in a fury. They wanted war, and
were eager to have it.</p>

<p>The heads of the government at Washington
felt the same way. Many millions of dollars
were voted by Congress, and much of this was
spent in buying ships and hiring and repairing
ships, and much more of it in getting the army
ready for war.</p>

<p>For Congress was as full of war-feeling as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
the people. President McKinley would have
liked to have peace, but he could no more hold
back the people and Congress than a man with
an ox-chain could hold back a locomotive. So
it was that, two months after the <i>Maine</i> sank
in the mud of Havana harbor, like a great
coffin filled with the dead, war was declared
against Spain.</p>

<p>Now, I wish to tell you how the loss of the
<i>Maine</i> was avenged. I am not going to tell
you here all about what our navy did in the
war. There are some good stories to tell about
that. But just here we have to think about the
<i>Maine</i> and her murdered men, and have to tell
about how one of her officers paid Spain back
for the dreadful deed.</p>

<p>As soon as the telegraph brought word to the
fleet at Key West that "War is declared," the
great ships lifted their anchors and sped away,
bound for Cuba, not many miles to the south.
And about a month afterward this great fleet
of battleships, and monitors, and cruisers, and
gunboats were in front of the harbor of Santiago,
holding fast there Admiral Cervera and
his men, who were in Santiago harbor with the
finest warships owned by Spain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>There were in the American fleet big ships
and little ships, strong ships and weak ships;
and one of the smallest of them all was the
little <i>Gloucester</i>. This had once been a pleasure
yacht, used only for sport. It was now
a gunboat ready for war. It had only a few
small guns, but these were of the "rapid-fire"
kind, which could pour out iron balls almost
as fast as hailstones come from the sky in a
storm.</p>

<p>And in command of the <i>Gloucester</i> was Lieutenant
Wainwright, who had been night officer
of the <i>Maine</i> when that ill-fated ship was
blown up by a Spanish mine. The gallant lieutenant
was there to avenge his lost ship.</p>

<p>I shall tell you later about how the Spanish
ships dashed out of the harbor of Santiago
on the 3d of July and what happened to them.
Just now you wish to know what Lieutenant
Wainwright and the little <i>Gloucester</i> did on
that great day, and how Spain was made to
pay for the loss of the <i>Maine</i>.</p>

<p>As soon as the Spanish ships came out, the
<i>Gloucester</i> dashed at them, like a wasp trying
to sting an ox. She steamed right across the
mouth of the harbor until she almost touched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
one of the great Spanish ships, all the time
firing away like mad at its iron sides.</p>

<p>The brave Wainwright saw two little boats
coming out behind these big ones. These were
what are called torpedo-boats.</p>

<p>Do you know what this means? A torpedo-boat
is little, but it can dart through the water
with the speed of the wind. And it carries
torpedoes&mdash;iron cases filled with dynamite&mdash;which
it can shoot out against the great warships.
One of these could tear a gaping hole
in the side of a battleship and send it, with all
on board, to the bottom. A torpedo-boat is the
rattlesnake of the sea. It is little, but it is
deadly.</p>

<p>But Lieutenant Wainwright and the men of
the <i>Gloucester</i> were not afraid of the <i>Furor</i>
and the <i>Pluton</i>, the Spanish torpedo-boats. As
soon as they saw these boats they drove their
little vessel toward them at full speed. The
<i>Gloucester</i> came under the fire of one of the
Spanish forts, but she did not mind that any
more than if boys were throwing oyster-shells
at her.</p>

<p>Out from her guns came a torrent of balls
like water from a pump. But the water drops<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
were made of iron, and hit hard. The <i>Furor</i>
and <i>Pluton</i> tried to fire back, but their men
could not stand that iron rain. For twenty
minutes it kept on, and then all was over with
the torpedo-boats. They tried to run ashore,
but down to the bottom they both went. Of all
their men only about two dozen were picked up
alive. The rest sank to the bottom of the bay.</p>

<p>Thus Wainwright and his little yacht
avenged the <i>Maine</i>, and the dreadful tragedy
in Havana harbor was paid for in Santiago
Bay.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3>THE GREAT VICTORY OF MANILA BAY</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">Dewey Destroys a Fleet Without Losing a Man</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>GEORGE DEWEY was a Green Mountain
boy, a son of the Vermont hills. Many
good stories are told of his schoolboy
days, and when he grew up to be a man everybody
that knew him said that he was a fine
fellow, who would make his mark. And they
were right about him, though he had to wait
a long time for the chance to show what he
would do.</div>

<p>Dewey was sent to the Naval Academy at
Annapolis, Maryland, and when the Civil War
began he was a lieutenant in the navy. He
was with Farragut on the Mississippi, and did
some gallant deeds on that great river.</p>

<p>When the war with Spain began Dewey was
on the Chinese coast with a squadron of American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
ships. He had been raised in rank and
was Commodore Dewey then. A commodore,
you should know, was next above a captain and
next below an admiral.</p>

<p>Commodore Dewey had four fine ships, the
cruisers <span class="smcap">Olympia</span>, <span class="smcap">Baltimore</span>, <span class="smcap">Raleigh</span>, and <span class="smcap">Boston</span>.
He had also two gunboats and a despatch-boat,
making seven in all.</p>

<p>These vessels were at Hong Kong, a British
seaport in China. They could not stay there
after war with Spain was declared, for Hong
Kong was a neutral port, and after war begins
fighting ships must leave neutral ports. But
Dewey knew where to go, for under the ocean
and over the land there had come to him a telegram
from Washington, more than ten thousand
miles away, which said, "Seek the Spanish
fleet and capture or destroy it." Dewey did
not waste any time in obeying orders.</p>

<p>He knew where to seek the Spanish fleet. A
few hundred miles away to the east of China
lay the fine group of islands called the Philippines,
which then belonged to Spain. In Luzon,
the biggest of these islands, was the fine large
City of Manila, the centre of the Spanish power
in the East. So straight across the China Sea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
Dewey went at all speed towards this seaport
of Spain.</p>

<p>On the morning of Saturday, April 30, 1898,
the men on the leading ship saw land rising in
the distance, green and beautiful, and farther
away they beheld the faint blue lines of the
mountains of Luzon. Down this green tropical
coast they sped, and when night was near
at hand they came close to the entrance of
Manila Bay.</p>

<p>Here there were forts to pass; and the ships
were slowed up. Dewey was ready to fight
with ships, but he did not want to fight with
forts, so he waited for darkness to come before
going in. He thought that he might then pass
these forts without being seen by the men in
them.</p>

<p>They waited until near midnight, steaming
slowly along until they came to the entrance to
the bay. The moon was in the sky, but gray
clouds hid its light. They could see the two
dark headlands of the harbor's mouth rising
and, between them, a small, low island. On
this island were the forts which they had to
pass.</p>

<p>As they came near, all the lights on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
ships were put out or hidden, except a small
electric light at the stern of each ship, for the
next one to see and follow.</p>

<p>Steam was put on, and the ships glided
swiftly and silently in, like shadows in the
darkness. All was silent in the Spanish forts.
The sentinels seemed fast asleep.</p>

<p>Some of the ships had passed before the
Spaniards waked up. Then a rocket shot up
into the air, and there came a deep boom and
a flash of flame. A shell went whizzing
through the darkness over the ships and
plunged into the water beyond.</p>

<p>Some shots were fired back, but in a few
minutes it was all over and Dewey's squadron
was safe in Manila Bay. The gallant American
sailors had made their way into the lion's
den.</p>

<p>The Bay of Manila is a splendid body of
water, running many miles into the land. The
City of Manila is about twenty miles from the
harbor's mouth, and the ships had to go far in
before its distant lights were seen, gleaming
like faint stars near the earth.</p>

<p>But it was not the city Dewey was after. He
was seeking the Spanish fleet. When the dawn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
came, and the sun rose behind the city, he saw
sails gleaming in its light. But these were
merchant vessels, not the warships he had come
so far to find.</p>

<p>The keen eyes of the commodore soon saw
the ships he was after. There they lay, across
the mouth of the little bay of Cavite, south of
the city, a group of ships-of-war, nine or ten
in number.</p>

<p>This brings us to the beginning of the great
naval battle of the war. Let us stop now and
take a look around. If you had been there I
know what you would have said. You would
have said that the Americans were sure to win,
for they had the biggest ships and the best
guns. Yes, but you must remember that the
Spaniards were at home, while the Americans
were not; and that makes a great difference.
If they had met out on the open sea Dewey
would have had the best of the game. But
here were the Spanish ships drawn up in a line
across a narrow passage, with a fort on the
right and a fort on the left, and with dynamite
mines under the water. And they knew all
about the distances and soundings and should
have known just how to aim their guns so as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
to hit a mark at any distance. All this the
Americans knew nothing about.</p>

<p>When we think of this it looks as if Dewey
had the worst of the game. But some of you
may say that the battle will tell best which side
had the best and which the worst. Yes, that's
true; but we must always study our players
before we begin our game.</p>

<p>George Dewey did not stop long to think
and study. He was there to take his chances.
The minute he saw the Spanish ships he went
for them as a football player goes for the line
of his opponents.</p>

<p>Forward went the American squadron, with
the Stars and Stripes floating proudly at every
mast-head. First of all was the flagship
<i>Olympia</i>, with Dewey standing on its bridge.
Behind came the other ships in a long line.</p>

<p>As they swept down in front of the city the
great guns of the forts sent out their balls.
Then the batteries on shore began to fire. Then
the Spanish ships joined in. There was a terrible
roar. Just in front of the <i>Olympia</i> two
mines exploded, sending tons of water into
the air. But they had been set off too soon, and
no harm was done.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>All this time the American ships swept
grandly on, not firing a gun; and Dewey stood
still on the bridge while shot and shell from the
Spanish guns went hurling past. He was
there to see, and danger did not count just
then.</p>

<p>As they drove on an old sea-dog raised the
cry, "Remember the <i>Maine</i>!" and in a minute
the shout ran through the ship. Still on went
the <i>Olympia</i>, like a great mastiff at which curs
are barking. At length Dewey spoke,&mdash;</p>

<p>"You may fire when you are ready, Captain
Gridley," he said. Captain Gridley was ready
and waiting. In an instant a great eight-inch
shell from the <i>Olympia</i> went screaming
through the air.</p>

<p>This was the signal. The <i>Baltimore</i> and the
<i>Boston</i> followed, and before five minutes had
passed every ship was pouring shot and shell
on the Spanish squadron and forts. Great guns
and small guns, slow-fire guns and rapid-fire
guns, hand guns and machine guns, all
boomed and barked together, and their shot
whistled and screamed, until it sounded like a
mighty carnival of death.</p>

<p>Down the Spanish line swept the American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
ships. Then they turned and swept back, firing
from the other side of the ships. Six times,
this way, they passed the Spanish ships, while
the air was full of great iron balls and dense
clouds of smoke floated over all.</p>

<p>You will not ask which side had the best of
the battle after I tell you one thing. The Americans
had been trained to aim and fire, and the
Spaniards had not. Here overhead flew a
Spanish shell. There another plunged into the
water without reaching a ship. Hardly one of
them reached its mark. Not an American was
killed or wounded. A box of powder went off
and hurt a few men, and that was all.</p>

<p>But the Spanish ships were rent and torn
like deer when lions get among them, and their
men fell by dozens at a time. It was one of the
most one-sided fights ever seen.</p>

<p>Admiral Montojo, of the Spanish fleet, could
not stand this. He started out with his flagship,
named the <i>Reina Cristina</i>, straight for
the <i>Olympia</i>, which he hoped to cut in two.
But as soon as his ship appeared all the American
ships turned their guns on it, and riddled
it with a frightful storm of iron.</p>

<p>The brave Spaniard saw that his ship would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
be sunk if he went on. He turned to run back,
but as he did so a great eight-inch shell struck
his ship in the stern and went clear through to
the bow, scattering death and destruction on
every side. It exploded one of the boilers. It
blew open the deck. It set the ship on fire.
White smoke came curling up. The ship fought
on as the fire burned, but she was past hope.</p>

<p>Two torpedo-boats came out, but they could
not stand the storm any better than the <i>Reina
Cristina</i>. In a few minutes one of them was
cut through and went like a stone to the bottom.
The other ran in faster than she had
come out and went ashore.</p>

<p>For two hours this dreadful work went on.
Then Dewey thought it was time to give his
men a rest and let them have some breakfast,
so he steamed away. Three of the Spanish
ships were burning like so much tinder, and it
was plain that the battle was as good as won.</p>

<p>A little after eleven o'clock the American
ships came back fresh as ever, all of them with
the Stars and Stripes afloat. The Spanish flag
was flying too, but nearly every ship was in
flames. But the Spaniards were not whipped
yet. They began to fire again, and so for another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
hour the fight went on. At the end of
that time the guns were silenced, the flags had
gone down, and the battle was won.</p>

<p>That was the end of the most one-sided victory
in the history of the American navy. All
the Spanish ships were on fire and had sunk in
the shallow bay. Hundreds of their men were
dead or wounded. The American ships were
nearly as good as ever, for hardly a shot had
struck them, and only eight men were slightly
hurt. The Spaniards had fired fast enough, but
they had wasted nearly all their shot.</p>

<p>When the people of the United States heard
of this great victory they were wild with delight.
Before that very few had heard of
George Dewey; now he was looked on as one
of our greatest naval heroes. "Dewey on the
bridge," with shot and shell screaming about
him, was as fine a figure as "Farragut in the
shrouds" had once been.</p>

<p>Congress made him a rear-admiral at once,
and soon after they made him an admiral.
This is the highest rank in the American navy.
Only Farragut and Porter had borne it before.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h3>HOBSON AND THE SINKING OF THE "MERRIMAC"</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">An Heroic Deed Worthy of the American Navy</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>SOME of us know what a dark night is
and some of us don't. Those who live
in cities, under the glare of the electric
light, hardly ever see real darkness. One must
go far into the country, and be out on a cloudy
night, to know what it means to be really in
the dark. Or to be out at sea, with not a light
above or below.</div>

<p>It was on such a night that a great black
hulk moved like a sable monster through the
waters off the coast of Cuba. This was the
night of June 3, 1898. There was a moon
somewhere in the sky, but thick clouds lay over
it and snuffed out its light. And on the vessel
not a light was to be seen and not a sound could
be heard. It was like a mighty beast gliding
on its prey.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>This vessel was the <i>Merrimac</i>, which had
carried a load of coal to the American fleet that
lay outside of Santiago de Cuba. Inside the
harbor there were four fine Spanish ships-of-war.
But these were like foxes run into their
hole, with the hunters waiting for them outside.</p>

<p>The harbor of Santiago is something like a
great, mis-shipen water-bottle, and the passage
into the harbor is like the neck of the
bottle. Now, if you want to keep anything
from getting out of a bottle you drive a cork
into its neck. And that is just what the Americans
were trying to do. The <i>Merrimac</i> was
the cork with which they wanted to fasten up
the Spanish ships in the water-bottle of Santiago.</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Merrimac</i> was a young
officer named Richard P. Hobson, who was
ready to give his life, if he must, for his country.
Admiral Sampson did not like to send
anyone into such terrible danger, but the daring
young man insisted on going, and he had
no trouble in getting seven men to go with him.</p>

<p>Most of the coal had been taken out of the
<i>Merrimac</i>, but there was enough left to sink<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
her to the bottom like a stone. And along both
sides there had been placed a row of torpedoes,
filled with gunpowder and with electric wires
to set them off when the right time came.</p>

<p>Hobson was to try to take the ship to the
right spot, and then to blow holes in her sides
with the torpedoes and sink her across the
channel. Would not he and his men sink with
her? Oh, well, they took the chances on that.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Hobson had a fine plan laid out;
but the trouble with fine plans is that they do
not always work in a fine way. He was to go
in to where the channel was very narrow.
Then he was to let the anchor fall and swing
the ship round crossways with the rudder.
Then he would touch the button to fire the torpedoes.
When that was done they would all
jump overboard and swim to the little boat that
was towed astern. They expected the <i>Merrimac</i>
would sink across the channel and thus
cork it up.</p>

<p>That was the plan. Don't you think it was
a very good one? I am sure Lieutenant Hobson
and Admiral Sampson thought so, and felt
sure they were going to give the Spaniards a
great deal of trouble.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>It was about three o'clock when the <i>Merrimac</i>
came into the mouth of the channel.
Here it was pitch dark and as still as death.
But the Spaniards were not asleep. They had
a small picket-boat in the harbor's mouth, on
the lookout for trouble, and its men saw a
deeper darkness moving through the darkness.</p>

<p>They thought it must be one of the American
warships and rowed out and fired several
shots at it. One of these hit the chains of the
rudder and carried them off. That spoiled
Hobson's plan of steering across the channel.
You see, as I have just told you, it does not
take much to spoil a good plan.</p>

<p>The alarm was given and the Spaniards in
the forts roused up. They looked out and saw
this dark shadow gliding swiftly on through
the gloom. They, too, thought it must be an
American battleship, and that the whole fleet
might be coming close behind to attack the
ships in the harbor.</p>

<p>The guns of Morro Castle and of the shore
batteries began to rain their balls on the <i>Merrimac</i>.
Then the Spanish ships joined in and
fired down the channel until there was a terrible
roar. And as the <i>Merrimac</i> drove on, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
dynamite mine under the water went off behind
her, flinging the water into the air, but
not doing her any harm.</p>

<p>The cannonade was fierce and fast, but the
darkness and the smoke of the guns hid the
<i>Merrimac</i>, and she went on unhurt. Soon the
narrow part of the channel was reached. Then
the anchor was dropped to the bottom and the
engines were made to go backward. The helm
was set, but the ship did not turn. Hobson
now first learned that the rudder chains were
gone and the ship could not be steered. The
little picket-boat had spoiled his fine plan.</p>

<p>There was only one thing left to do. He
touched the electric button. In a second a dull
roar came up from below and the ship pitched
and rolled. A thousand pounds of powder had
exploded and blown great jagged holes in the
ship's sides.</p>

<p>Hobson and his men leaped over the side
into the water. Those who were slow about it
were flung over by the shock. Down plunged
the <i>Merrimac</i> beneath the waves, while loud
cheers came from the forts. The Spanish gunners
were glad, for they thought they had
sunk a great American battleship.</p>

<span class="caption">Hobson Blowing up the Merrimac.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>But it does not matter to us what the Spaniards
thought. All we want to know is what
became of Lieutenant Hobson and his daring
men. Their little boat had been carried away
by a Spanish shot, and they were swimming in
the deep waters without knowing what would
be their fate. On one side was the sea; on the
other were the Spaniards: they did not know
which would be the worst.</p>

<p>"I swam away from the ship as soon as I
struck the water," said Hobson, "but I could
feel the eddies drawing me backward in spite
of all I could do. That did not last long,
however, and as soon as I felt the tugging
cease I turned and struck out for the float,
which I could see dimly bobbing up and down
over the sunken hull."</p>

<p>The float he spoke of was a sort of raft
which lay on the ship's deck, with a rope tied
to it so as to let it float. The rope pulled one
side of it a little under the water, so that the
other side was a little above the water.</p>

<p>This was a good thing for Hobson and his
men, for Spanish boats were soon rowing out
to where the ship had gone down. The eight
men got under the high side of the raft, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
held on to it by putting their fingers through
the crevices.</p>

<p>"All night long we stayed there with our
noses and mouths barely out of the water," says
Hobson.</p>

<p>They were afraid to speak or move, for fear
they would be shot by the men in the boats.
It was that way all night long. Boats kept
rowing about, some of them very close, but
nobody thought of looking under the raft. The
water felt warm at first, but after a while it
felt cold, and their fingers ached and their teeth
chattered.</p>

<p>One of the men, who thought he could not
stand this any longer, left the raft and started
to swim ashore. Hobson had to call him back.
He came at once, but the call was heard on
the boats and they rowed swiftly up. But they
did not find the hiding place of the men and
rowed away again.</p>

<p>After daylight came Hobson saw a steam-launch
approaching from the ships. There
were officers in it, and when it came near he
gave it a hail. His voice seemed to scare the
men on board, for they backed off in great
haste.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>They were still more surprised when they
saw a number of men clamber out from under
the float. The marines in the launch were
about to fire, but the officers would not let them.</p>

<p>Then Hobson swam towards the launch and
called out in Spanish:</p>

<p>"Is there an officer on board?"</p>

<p>"Yes," came the reply.</p>

<p>"I have seven men to surrender," said Hobson.</p>

<p>He now swam up and was seized and lifted
out of the water. One of the men who had
hold of him was Admiral Cervera, the commander
of the Spanish fleet.</p>

<p>The admiral gave an odd look at the queer
kind of fish he had caught. Hobson had been
in the engine-room of the <i>Merrimac</i> and was
covered with oil, coal-dust, and soot. But he
wore his officer's belt, and when he pointed to
that the admiral smiled and bade him welcome.</p>

<p>Then the men were taken on board the
launch, where they were well treated. They
had come very near death and had escaped.</p>

<p>Of course, you want to read the rest of this
story. Well, they were locked up in Morro
Castle. This was a fine old fort on the cliff at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
the harbor's mouth, where they could see the
great shells come in from the ships and explode,
and see the Spanish gunners fire back.</p>

<p>Admiral Cervera was very kind to them and
sent word to Admiral Sampson that they were
safe, and that he would exchange them for
Spanish prisoners.</p>

<p>They were not exchanged until July 7, and
by that time Admiral Cervera's ships had all
been destroyed and he was a prisoner himself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h3>SAMPSON AND SCHLEY WIN RENOWN</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Greatest Sea Fight of the Century</span></h3>

<div class='cap'>I &nbsp;&nbsp;HAVE told you what Hobson did and what
Wainwright did at Santiago. Now it is
time to tell all about what the ships did
there; the story of the great Spanish dash for
liberty and its woeful ending.</div>

<p>Santiago is the second city of Cuba. It lies
as far to the east as Havana does to the west,
and is on the south of the island, while Havana
is on the north. Like Havana, it has a fine
harbor, which is visited by many ships.</p>

<p>Well, soon after the war with Spain began,
our naval captains were in trouble. They had
a riddle given them for which they could not
find the answer. There was a squadron of
Spanish warships at sea, and nobody knew
where to look for them. They might fire into
the cities along the coast and do no end of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
damage. Maybe there was not much danger
of this; but there is nothing sure in war, and
it does not take much to scare some people.</p>

<p>The navy wanted to be on the safe side, so
one part of the fleet was put on the lookout
along our coast; and another part, under Commodore
Schley, went around the west end of
the island of Cuba; and a third part, under Admiral
Sampson, went to the east. They were
all on the hunt for the Spanish ships, but for
days and days nothing of them was to be seen.</p>

<p>After they had looked into this hole and
into that hole along the coast, like sea-dogs
hunting a sea-coon, word came that the Spanish
ships had been seen going into Santiago
harbor. Then straight for Santiago went all
the fleet, with its captains very glad to have
the answer to the riddle.</p>

<p>Never before had the United States so splendid
a fleet to fight with. There were five fine
battleships, the <i>Iowa</i>, the <i>Indiana</i>, the <i>Massachusetts</i>,
the <i>Oregon</i>, and the <i>Texas</i>. Then
there was the <i>New York</i>, Admiral Sampson's
flagship, and the <i>Brooklyn</i>, Commodore
Schley's flagship. These were steel-clad cruisers,
not so heavy, but much faster than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
battleships. Besides these there were monitors,
and cruisers, and gunboats, and vessels
of other kinds, all spread like a net around the
mouth of the harbor, ready to catch any big
fish that might swim out. Do you not think
that was a pretty big crowd of ships to deal
with the Spanish squadron, which had only
four cruisers and two torpedo-boats?</p>

<p>But then, you know, the insider sometimes
has a better chance than the outsider. It is
not easy to keep such a crowd of vessels together
out at sea. They run out of coal, or
get out of order, or something else happens.
If the insider keeps his eyes wide open and
waits long enough his chance will come.</p>

<p>Admiral Cervera, the Spanish commander,
was in a very tight place. Outside lay the
American ships, and inside was the American
army, which kept pushing ahead and was likely
to take Santiago in a few days. If he waited
he might be caught like a rat in a trap. And
if he came outside he might be caught like a
fish in a net. He thought it all over and he
made up his mind that it was better to be a
fish than a rat, so he decided to come out of
the harbor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<p>He waited till the 3d of July. On that day
there were only five of the big ships outside&mdash;four
of the battleships and the cruiser <i>Brooklyn</i>.
And two of the battleships were a little
out of order and were being made right. Admiral
Sampson had gone up the coast with the
<i>New York</i> for a talk with the army general,
so he was out of the way.</p>

<p>No doubt the Spanish lookouts saw all this
and told their admiral what they had seen. So,
on that Sunday morning, with every vessel
under full steam, the Spaniards raised their
anchors and started on their last cruise.</p>

<p>Now let us take a look at the big ships outside.
On these everybody was keeping Sunday.
The officers had put on their best Sunday
clothes, and the men were lying or lounging
idly about the deck. Of course, there were
lookouts aloft. Great ships like these always
have their lookouts. A war-vessel never quite
goes to sleep. It always keeps one eye open.
This Sunday morning the lookouts saw smoke
coming up the harbor, but likely enough they
thought that the Spaniards were frying fish
for their Sunday breakfast.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 331px;">
<img src="images/i-349.jpg" width="331" height="500" alt="The Fighting Top of the Texas." title="" />
<a href="images/i-349-big.jpg"><span class="caption">The Fighting Top of the Texas.</span></a>
</div>

<p>And so the hours went on until it was about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
half-past nine. Then an officer on the <i>Brooklyn</i>
called to the lookout aloft:</p>

<p>"Isn't that smoke moving?"</p>

<p>The answer came back with a yell that made
everybody jump:</p>

<p>"There's a big ship coming out of the harbor!"</p>

<p>In a second the groups of officers and men
were on their feet and wide-awake. The Spaniards
were coming! Nobody now wanted to be
at home or to go a-fishing. There were bigger
fish coming into their net.</p>

<p>"Clear the ship for action!" cried Commodore
Schley.</p>

<p>From every part of the ship the men rushed
to their quarters. Far down below the stokers
began to shovel coal like mad into the furnaces.
In the turrets the gun-crews hurried
to get their guns ready. The news spread like
lightning, and the men made ready like magic
for the terrible work before them.</p>

<p>It was the same on all the ships as on the
<i>Brooklyn</i>, for all of them saw the Spaniards
coming. Down past the wreck of the <i>Merrimac</i>
sped Cervera's ships, and headed for the
open sea. First came the <i>Maria Teresa</i>, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
admiral's flagship. Then came the <i>Vizcaya</i>,
the <i>Oquendo</i>, and the <i>Cristobal Colon</i>, and
after them the two torpedo-boats.</p>

<p>"Full speed ahead! Open fire!" roared the
commodore from the bridge of the <i>Brooklyn</i>,
and in a second there came a great roar and a
huge iron globe went screaming towards the
Spanish ships.</p>

<p>It was the same on the other ships. Five
minutes before they had been swinging lazily
on the long rolling waves, everybody at rest.
Now clouds of black smoke came pouring from
their funnels, every man was at his post, every
gun ready for action, and the great ships were
beginning to move through the water at the
full power of the engines. And from every
one of them came flashes as of lightning, and
roars as of thunder, and huge shells went
whirling through the air toward the Spanish
ships.</p>

<p>Out of the channel they dashed, four noble
ships, and turned to the west along the coast.
Only the <i>Brooklyn</i> was on that side of the
harbor, and for ten minutes three of the Spanish
ships poured at her a terrible fire.</p>

<p>But soon the <i>Oregon</i>, the <i>Indiana</i>, the <i>Iowa</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
and the <i>Texas</i> came rapidly up, and the Spanish
gunners had new game to fire at.</p>

<p>You might suppose that the huge iron shells,
whirling through the air, and bursting with a
frightful roar, would tear and rend the ships
as though they were made of paper.</p>

<p>But just think how it was at Manila, where
the Spaniards fired at the sea and the sky, and
the Americans fired at the Spanish ships. It
was the same here at Santiago. The Spaniards
went wild with their guns and wasted
their balls, while the Americans made nearly
every shot tell.</p>

<p>It was a dreadful tragedy for Spain that day
on the Cuban coast. The splendid ships which
came out of the harbor so stately and trim,
soon looked like ragged wrecks. In less than
half an hour two of them were ashore and in
a fierce blaze, and the two others were flying
for life. The first to yield was the <i>Maria
Teresa</i>, the flagship of the admiral. One shell
from the <i>Brooklyn</i> burst in her cabin and in a
second it was in flames. One from the <i>Texas</i>
burst in the engine-room and broke the steam-pipe.
Some burst on the deck; some riddled
the hull; death and terror were everywhere.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>The men were driven from the guns, the
flames rose higher, the water poured in through
the shot holes, and there was nobody to work
the pumps. All was lost, and the ship was run
ashore and her flag pulled down.</p>

<p>In very few minutes the <i>Oquendo</i> followed
the flagship ashore, both of them looking like
great blazing torches. The shells from the
great guns had torn her terribly, many of her
crew had been killed, and those who were left
had to run her ashore to keep her from going
to the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>In half an hour, as you may see, two of the
Spanish ships had been half torn to pieces and
driven ashore, and only two were still afloat.
These were the <i>Vizcaya</i> and the <i>Cristobal
Colon</i>. When the <i>Maine</i> was sent to Havana,
before the beginning of the war, a Spanish
warship was sent to New York. This was the
<i>Vizcaya</i>. She was a trim and handsome ship
and her officers had a hearty welcome.</p>

<p>It was a different sort of welcome she now
got. The <i>Brooklyn</i> and the <i>Oregon</i> were after
her and her last day had come. So hot was the
fire that her men were driven from their guns
and flames began to appear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she, too, was run ashore and her flag
was hauled down. It was just an hour after
the chase began and she had gone twenty miles
down the coast. Now she lay blazing redly
on the shallow shore and in the night she blew
up. It was a terrible business, the ruin of
those three fine vessels.</p>

<p>There was one more Spanish ship, the <i>Cristobal
Colon</i>. (This is the Spanish for Christopher
Columbus.) She was the fastest of
them all, and for a time it looked as if Spain
might save one of her ships.</p>

<p>But there were bloodhounds on her track,
the <i>Brooklyn</i>, six miles behind, and the <i>Oregon</i>,
more than seven miles away.</p>

<p>Swiftly onward fled the deer, and swiftly
onward followed the war-hounds. Mile by
mile they gained on the chase. About one
o'clock, when she was four miles away, the
<i>Oregon</i> sent a huge shell whizzing from one
of her great 13-inch guns. It struck the water
just behind the <i>Colon</i>; but another that followed
struck the water ahead.</p>

<p>Then the <i>Brooklyn</i> tried her eight-inch guns,
and sent a shell through the <i>Colon's</i> side, above
her belt of steel. For twenty minutes this was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
kept up. The <i>Colon</i> was being served like her
consorts. At the end of that time her flag was
pulled down and the last of the Spanish ships
ran ashore. She had made a flight for life of
nearly fifty miles.</p>

<p>This, you see, is not the story of a sea-fight;
it is the story of a sea-chase. Much has been
said about who won the honor at Santiago,
but I think any of you could tell that in a few
words. It was the men who ran the engines
and who aimed the guns that won the game.
The commanders did nothing but run after the
runaway Spaniards, and there is no great
honor in that. What else was there for them
to do? They could not run the other way.</p>
